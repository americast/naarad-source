The SIH was primarily a code-fest in which software programmers were challenged to write programmes giving innovative solutions to more than 500 problem statements. The SIH-2017 elicited an enthusiastic response with more than 40,000 students participating. It was concluded in the first week of April 2017 with Hon\u2019ble PM addressing the participants. This is being followed with Smart India Hackathon-2018 which was formally launched details of which can be found in https://innovate.mygov.in/sih2018/.\n\nThe MHRD now proposes to expand the scope of SIH-2018 by including hardware section in it. This platform will provide an opportunity to the innovative minds to showcase their solutions at the national level. It is also proposed that the best entries at the national level would also be provided funding through the Research Parks and the Technology Business Incubators (TBIs) for product development for their eventual commercialisation/extensive social use.\n\nThe MHRD expects a good participation in this Hackathon from all the IITs and NITs.\nAll students are requested to provide ideas (with or without models/prototypes) that will be proposed as problem statements of the Smart India Hackathon 2018. This should be done by mailing the idea totech.gymkhana@gmail.com by 13th November, 2 AM.\n\nYou are also requested to go through the 400+ problem statements provided in the aforementioned link and register for the Hackathon.
