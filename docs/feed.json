They have the power to make the innocent look guilty and to make the guilty look innocent, and that's their power. Because they control the minds of the masses.' These sentiments echoed by Malcolm X have been proved many a time. But unfortunately, in recent times media outlets are not dedicated to what they should actually be looking for- ethics and truthfulness. Lots of instances can be cited which suggest that media is running recklessly after sensationalism and profit, which sadly, is directly proportional to how one can engage the common people with a spicy gossip. This has led media tending to report rumors, speculations, and projections as facts and in turn, misleading the major chunk of masses into believing them. <br> A recent news in a leading newspaper daily stating that IITBHU would be providing training to become ideal daughter-in-law shook us. Although the news garnered a lot of mass attention and surely helped the media houses gain its warranted popularity, but at what cost? Defaming an institution of national importance can never be justified on grounds of a false news. IIT BHU director had to convene a meeting with the top officials regarding the news and the institute has sent the clarification to all the media houses. A startup which was incubated at IIT BHU was taking some steps and the reporter thought it necessary to highlight it as an IIT BHU initiative so as to get the attention of masses. (Link to the report:  <a href='https://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-we-are-not-offering-an-ideal-daughter-in-law-course-iit-bhu-rejects-report-2659438' target='_blank'> https://www.dnaindia.com/... </a> ) <br> IITs, being the premier institutes of India, have been a sought-after topic of news reporting for the media. The status of IITs as mere screening institutes for providing jobs after a few years of study has been created thanks to media highlighting only about the highly paid jobs here. The hype that has been created around IITs being such institutes have cost the nation its research potential and reputation has been compromised.

Due to a staggering turnout of less than 10%, the event had to be postponed by at least half an hour, when the quorum was finally met. The first session, 'Motivational Lecture-II' had Dr Era Dutta, a consultant, neuropsychiatrist, therapist, and a life coach from Kolkata involving the students in an interactive talk about Success and Depression. With statistics and examples, the students explored the pervasive traits of depression, its correspondence with success and its cure, the happiness. 'Happiness is the whole pie and we are focusing only on success which is just a small chunk. Why not focus on the whole pie?', she said. The session thus ended with her advice to this post-millennial audience, which was to keep chanting a happiness mantra, 'Today was a good day.' <br>   <br> By 7:15, the strength has already increased to about 300 for the latter event of the day, 'Carrer Workshop-2' conducted by the External Relations Cell and the CDC. In continuation to the CV filling workshop of last week, this session involved an insight into various opportunities available for an undergraduate student at IIT Kharagpur.

Speculations included daily/weekly limit on data usage, attempt to track down the nature of data usage etc. We contacted Head (CIC) over these speculations and found out that none of these are true. <br> As per Head (CIC), there is no change in usage policy in terms of data limit and time of usage. It would be same as it has been till now. Currently, it will just require you to authenticate into the Wi-Fi network so that only valid users are allowed to use it. However, there will be a limit on the no. of devices connected at any one point of time from a single user id so that the user id is not misused. The limit will be reasonable given that a student may have multiple devices like laptop, 1-2 phones etc., and there will be this device limit for all including faculty and staff, not just students. Right now, CIC has enabled the authentication so that the IIT community starts using it and they will consider the feedbacks before they finally make the entire Wi-Fi access authenticated. This is why they have not turned off the non-authenticated SSIDs now. They will give sufficient notice to the entire IIT community before the whole Wi-Fi becomes authenticated.  <br> As for the concerns over tracking down the nature of data usage, he said that the IIT network is for everyone's academic and reasonable personal use only. CIC does not track the nature of data usage and this authentication process does not change that policy, but users should not indulge in misusing the Wi-Fi network for illegitimate purposes. A general guideline of usage can be found in the Policies link of  <a href='http://www.cic.iitkgp.ac.in' target='_blank'> www.cic.iitkgp.ac.in </a> .  <br>  <br> Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur encourages the students on campus to start using this authentication and report problems to CIC and provide them with feedbacks.", "real_time": "12:43PM", "pic": null, "flag": 1, "real_date": "22-06-2018", "read_more": 1}, {"source": "Awaaz IIT Kharagpur", "link": null, "id": "146188872068143_1888548587832154", "created_time": "2018-06-22T04:21:54+0000", "short_message": "Here's an important update regarding Wi-Fi facility on the campus. <br> Wi-Fi access inside IIT Kharagpur is soon going to require user authentication.", "message": "Here's an important update regarding Wi-Fi facility on the campus. <br> Wi-Fi access inside IIT Kharagpur is soon going to require user authentication.

Users are requested to start connecting to the secured SSIDs following the procedure below to access the wi-fi network.  <br>  <br> 1. Your user id is your ERP login.  <br>  <br> 2. To create your network access password, log in to your ERP account, and follow the link 'Set Campus Network Password' under the link for 'Home'. Set a password you will use for network access (should be different from your ERP password). You can change the password anytime again in the same manner.  <br>  <br> 3. Configure your device for wi-fi authentication. Step by step instructions for different OS (Android/Windows/Linux/Mac) can be found in the 'Wi-Fi Authentication' link in  <a href='http://www.cic.iitkgp.ac.in' target='_blank'> http://www.cic.iitkgp.ac.... </a> . Normally, you will have to do this configuration only once per secured SSID unless you change your password or want to login with some other user id.  <br>  <br> 4. Connect to the corresponding SSID.  <br>  <br> Please note the following:  <br>  <br> 1. Normally, you may need 10-15 seconds for connection the first time you configure, please be patient.  <br>  <br> 2. Faculty/Staff may share their password with their family members for wi-fi access. However, in order to avoid password misuse, there will be a limit for no. of simultaneous connections. Please note that the user with the user id is responsible for any misuse of the wi-fi network when connected with the user id.  <br>  <br> Note that for now the current non-secured SSIDs will stay open until further notice for wi-fi access by people with no ERP account such as guests, visitors, contractual staff needing access for their work etc. The policies for these classes of users and access methods will be circulated soon by CIC.  <br>  <br> However, users with ERP accounts are strongly advised to start using the secured SSIDs immediately and report any problems to CIC; the non-secured SSIDs will be withdrawn soon. <br>  <br> -CIC Support Team", "real_time": "09:51AM", "pic": null, "flag": 1, "real_date": "22-06-2018", "read_more": 1}, {"source": "Kharagpur Open Source Society", "link": "https://opensource.googleblog.com/2018/06/google-summer-of-code-2018-statistics-part-2.html", "id": "524856034258068_1747171222026537", "created_time": "2018-06-21T17:50:56+0000", "short_message": "While Google Summer of Code is in full swing now, Google has released some interesting stats for GSoC'18.  <br> IIT Kharagpur stands 4th globally with", "message": "While Google Summer of Code is in full swing now, Google has released some interesting stats for GSoC'18.  <br> IIT Kharagpur stands 4th globally with 22 students selected this year.

Rather than being merely physical exercise, It is one of the most favourable paths to establish a deep connection between one\u2019s body, soul and nature. Not to mention, the practice of Yoga imparts physical, mental and emotional health in one\u2019s life.  <br>  <br> United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) declared the International Yoga Day to be celebrated on 21st June which is also marked as the summer solstice, after being proposed by our Prime Minister, Mr. Narendra Modi.

But our team gave the best of the colleges which included the likes of University of British Columbia, Georgia Institute of Technology, University of Michigan-Ann Arbor, Ohio University etc., a run for their money. 7 teams from India contested in it including those from IIT Madras and IIT Kanpur. Team AGV finished as Runner-Up, while the winners were the team CART (Center for Applied Research and Technology), Inc. at Bluefield State College, USA.  <br>  <br> They needed to make a bot which can follow the lanes avoiding the obstacles by following given GPS coordinates. They designed forward wheel drive bot with castor at back. The one travelling the maximum distance of the given arena would go on to win the competition. Their bot travelled a remarkable 260 feets in the process of finishing as Runner Ups. <br>  <br> The entire AGV team had started assembling and modelling of the bot from December itself and with ample support from Prof. DrDebashish Chakravarty of Mining Engineering Department, their efforts got better and better.

And a special credit also goes to the first year members who worked relentlessly and contributed with great zeal and enthusiasm. <br>  <br> The Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition (IGVC) is an annual international robotics competition for teams of undergraduate and graduate students.

It has been many years since colleges like IIT Madras have been offering integrated MA programmes in Economics and English, while IIT Delhi offers two-year programme and IIT Kharagpur teaches even Law. <br>  <br> IIT Kharagpur is emerging as a center for arts and music for students as well as research scholars. It is focussing more on Indian classical music and musical instruments and has an ongoing collaboration with Pandit Ajoy Chakraborty in this field. Currently, IIT Kharagpur is providing training in music, fine arts, and the performing arts, and also is offering credit courses in the form of electives and micro- specializations. The center will also create national and international outreach programmes for dissemination and collaborative research on science and technology interventions in Indian classical music and arts. IIT Kharagpur intends to begin research on classic musical instruments to bring in innovative materials and processes to optimize cost and time on the making of instruments like sitar and sarod. The main motive behind all this is to create a deeper understanding of social values among the students and preserve the national heritage of the country. <br>  <br> Source:  <a href='https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/education/iitians-to-get-lessons-in-fine-arts-humanities/articleshow/64229799.cms?from=mdr' target='_blank'> https://economictimes.ind... </a> ", "real_time": "07:48PM", "pic": null, "flag": 1, "real_date": "21-05-2018", "read_more": 1}, {"pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/33116201_1850022531684760_2767644970985717760_o.jpg?_nc_cat=0&oh=3b005ec6df3baa6f528c129080117908&oe=5B88E492", "story": "Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur added 16 new photos.", "short_message": "In a quite shocking and startling revelation, it has been found out that a person who has been heavily followed on social media platforms and claimed himself", "source": "Awaaz IIT Kharagpur", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/awaaziitkgp/photos/a.146211918732505.22874.146188872068143/1850022525018094/?type=3", "id": "146188872068143_1850026548351025", "created_time": "2018-05-20T12:51:02+0000", "message": "In a quite shocking and startling revelation, it has been found out that a person who has been heavily followed on social media platforms and claimed himself to be an IIT KGP mechanical graduate everywhere, is not actually a KGPian and he has duped many people of large sums of money including many KGPians.

The 'end ride' option would be followed by a rating and feedback form where the rider can lodge complaints regarding the cycles or the service. Thereafter, the particular Pedal would be inactive for a period of 24 hours for maintenance displaying a message that the Pedal isn't available if anyone tries to book it during that period. <br> Even though the maintenance would be ensured by the technicians at Ola, being the prime stakeholders in this Institute and all the property that belongs to it, it is our duty to help and maintain these resources and prevent their vandalism, as our own responsibility. The sustenance of these resources would be crucial for the benefit of the entire IIT KGP community and we, as the members, should ensure it. It is up to us whether we can help this system grow or be demolished at the hands of our ignorance and irresponsibility. It is who makes the system and it is us who destroys it too.  <br> Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur believes that the IIT KGP community is responsible enough to understand and feel the importance of the service and would be ready to extend their help in sustaining the service and all the others, yet to arrive.

One of them didn't submit their contact details so we couldn't even reach them to let them know and hence had to take the next highest scorer present. We later got to know that there were two-three people who didn't want to see if they could qualify and didn't submit their answer sheet for checking, where it turned out that they would've actually qualified for the finals. The team that won actually had a member like that, who after giving up, decided to go to his room, from where he had to be called to come back for the finals and eventually won. The finals itself was a cliffhanger with the podium places getting decided in the last two questions of the quiz. <br>  <br> Furthermore, there were no women in attendance. An event, that has no barriers to entry, and no prerequisites for taking part, as well as cash prizes and refreshments where non-regulars to QC sessions turned up and performed very well had an entire section of our campus population giving it a miss in participation definitely speaks volumes about this. We invite discussion regarding this in the comments section, and more than discussion, ideas to improve this situation, considering that Quiz Club has brought laurels for the institute in multiple places throughout the past years and their current Quiz Week initiative is an attempt to lure in people who don't consider themselves knowledgeable enough. <br>  <br> Final Results: <br>  <br> First: B.

A team of post graduate students and faculty members from IIT Kharagpur seem to have finally found a solution for these clickbaits, that is, webpages with luring titles but irrelevant content. IIT-KGP's solution is a browser extension named 'Stop Clickbait' that can detect and block clickbaits with more than 90% accuracy. Following this up, they are working with Microsoft to assess the relevance of the revenue models of such advertisements. <br>  <br> The team has analysed linguistic patterns and complemented it with tracking news and twitter posts of different national and international media channels over several months to develop this extension which already has over a 2000 downloads. <br>  <br> Prof. Niloy Ganguly, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Kharagpur says,  <br> 'Our primary aim is to offer a choice to the readers.

Do you know when was the last time KGP Women\u2019s Basketball team had reached into the finals of Inter IIT Sports Meet? No, you might not be knowing! Let us tell you. It was 2004 and it\u2019s after a gap of 13 years that these girls have repeated the same in style by winning the silver medal with an undefeated run till finals! But this journey has neither been a cakewalk nor they were served it easily on a platter. They upped their ante throughout the tournament and took it to another level when it mattered most.  <br> In a fiercely contested contact sport which has high risks of players getting injured, the standard team size used to be 11 and the captain had requested for at least 10. But it was reduced to 9 since the administration felt that there is no need of those 2 extra players in a sport which didn\u2019t have prospects of winning a medal. The Woes didn\u2019t stop there. Out of 9 girls selected for the tournament, one of the most key players had to leave due to a medical emergency at her home. They lost their hopes for the tournament with their star player not being able to make it to the matches. Count goes to 8. One more player sustained an injury and couldn\u2019t play. Count goes to 7. One player was in beginning stages and lacked in the experience that it takes to play at bigger stages. Effective count goes to 6. How do you play a sports tournament which requires 5 players and is highly injury prone? Justina Mathew, Ravali Madambakam, Silla Spandana, Saloni Kirdak, Swati Rawat and Remee Patel did the unthinkable! These six players played the entire tournament (5 matches) without having much luxury of getting substitutes. Out of these players, another key player had an injury in her thumb, which was later found to be a fragment fracture. But she didn't give up, she still took the risk and played all the matches. How about that for an example of perseverance? \u201cA basketball team is like the five fingers on your hand. If you can get them all together, you have a fist.\u201d And they proved so. They not only played, they also topped their pool and steamrolled opponent to reach all the way to finals with 4 wins out of 5 matches in their campaign. And along with winning hearts, they did manage to break the stereotype of basketball being the sport of only tall people. They did it all with good dribblers and long distance shooters. <br>  <br> In the first match itself, they were pitted against the hosts IIT Madras. Loud cheering, home supporters, taller players and what not! And guess what? They announced their arrival in style by beating the favourite hosts by 18-16. The team that no one was giving a chance to put up a fight has suddenly started looking threatening. As if that was not enough, their second successive win over IIT (ISM) Dhanbad by 15-8 sent a strong caution to the winds that they were here to stay, compete and win; not just to make up for the numbers. They gathered the momentum and their victory chariot didn\u2019t stop there. In Quarter Finals, they comprehensively dribbled past IIT BHU by 23-19, sending shivers down the spine of opponents. It was an all-important Semi-Final clash with IIT Bombay. Stakes were high and odds were unfavourable but they rose to the occasion and delivered a nasty blow to Bombay\u2019s hopes of going into Finals. It was tie neck to neck until the last moment when KGP got two free shots in the last 10 seconds of the match. The captain committed no mistake in firing them and the second one went in giving KGP a lead of one point. Can you believe that? A team which was being seen as the one participating just for formality and were no believers in them getting into knockout stages was into the finals! In the finals, they screamed, they ran ferociously, they dribbled hard, they threw all they had, they put each iota of energy their muscles could but credit to the opponents, they were simply better that day. As our players admitted, IIT Roorkee deserved the gold medal. Though they lost by 25-44, their entire campaign was studded with brilliant moments \u2013 the moments they can take pride on! It was nothing less than a roller coaster ride for them where they defied their own expectations and proved the pundits wrong. All the practice, hard work and perseverance bore sweet fruits.  <br> It wasn\u2019t their victory alone. It was also a big win for their coach Mr Soumen Mondal who played a pivotal role in motivating the team and strategizing for each match. He believed in them and always reminded them of their potential of getting a podium finish. As the players said, \u201cWithout his strategies, the victory wasn\u2019t possible.\u201d The never-say-die attitude of the team was all he wanted and girls didn\u2019t disappoint him. The captain Remee marshalled her troop well and her leadership was the key to this entire campaign. A huge shout to these amazing girls!  <br> What lies in the future? Most of the current players are graduating out. The team needs enthusiastic and dedicated junior players to fill the boots. As one of the players admitted, even during the practice sessions, participation from juniors was very less. They had a hard time choosing 9 players for the tournament. Participation from girls was utterly disappointing. And if that\u2019s what will keep on going, we don\u2019t stand a chance in rewriting histories in the upcoming Sports Meets. The current players have appealed to the girls to participate in as large numbers as possible. The sports scenario in KGP among girls isn\u2019t in very good shape right now. We needed inspirations to look up to. Now that we have some of them, why to wait? Hit the ground on the very first day of the next semester!", "flag": 1, "real_time": "08:33PM", "real_date": "25-12-2017", "read_more": 1}, {"source": "The Scholar\"s Avenue", "link": null, "id": "156819310131_10155832087510132", "created_time": "2017-12-23T05:36:33+0000", "short_message": "Inter IIT | Basketball (Men) <br> KGP bag gold!

This platform will provide an opportunity to the innovative minds to showcase their solutions at the national level. It is also proposed that the best entries at the national level would also be provided funding through the Research Parks and the Technology Business Incubators (TBIs) for product development for their eventual commercialisation/extensive social use. <br>  <br> The MHRD expects a good participation in this Hackathon from all the IITs and NITs. <br>  <br> All students are requested to provide ideas (with or without models/prototypes) that will be proposed as problem statements of the Smart India Hackathon 2018. This should be done by mailing the idea totech.gymkhana@gmail.com by 13th November, 2 AM. <br>  <br> You are also requested to go through the 400+ problem statements provided in the aforementioned link and register for the Hackathon. The problem statements are both software and hardware based.", "real_time": "01:25PM", "pic": null, "flag": 1, "real_date": "12-11-2017", "read_more": 1}, {"source": "Kharagpur Open Source Society", "link": "http://kwoc.kossiitkgp.in/", "id": "524856034258068_1519218988155096", "created_time": "2017-11-10T18:45:12+0000", "short_message": "We are happy to announce that we are hosting Kharagpur Winter of Code (KWoC) 2017, in association with Kshitij, IIT Kharagpur, this December to help students", "message": "We are happy to announce that we are hosting Kharagpur Winter of Code (KWoC) 2017, in association with Kshitij, IIT Kharagpur, this December to help students (it doesn't matter who you are as long as you are willing to learn) make their first real contributions to open source projects.

Fondly remembered by many students and admirers. <br>  <br> Amherst - Madhukar Anant Rege passed away at age 92, on September 20th, 2016, after a long illness and a long, full life on three continents. <br>  <br> Born in Ratnagiri on the Konkan Coast of India, he had a happy, active childhood. From an early age he loved drawing and painting and eventually earned a Diploma in Architecture at the J.J. School of Art in Bombay, after apprenticing for a year with the master watercolorist Sawlaram Haldankar. In 1949, at age 25, he set sail for England with the help of his eldest brother Vinayak, where he successfully sat the R.I.B.A. (Royal Institute of British Architects) examination and then completed a post-graduate Diploma in Town Planning. <br>  <br> It was in England that he met and married Gladys Sharp on July 4th, 1953, and, after the birth of their first daughter in 1954, returned to India, where he took up a lectureship in Architecture at the newly formed Indian Institute of Technology in Kharagpur, West Bengal. He was to stay at I.I.T. for 14 years, aside from a year's leave in London and a three-year period in Athens, Greece where he worked with the pioneering Doxiadis Associates, after which he returned to Kharagpur as Professor and Head of the Department of Architecture and City Planning. <br>  <br> In 1969 he migrated to the United States, first as a SPURS (Special Program for Urban and Regional Studies) Fellow at M.I.T. in Cambridge, Massachusetts, then as a city planner for the City of Newton and eventually as a planner for the Massachusetts Executive Office of Communities and Development, where he worked in the Main Street Program on downtown revitalization of Mass. cities and towns. He also lectured at the Boston Architectural Center. When his wife and daughters joined him in 1970, he moved first to Brookline, then to Newton, and, upon retirement in 1993, settled with Gladys in Amherst. After retirement he returned to his first passion, painting, which he had kept up throughout his life, filling his home with beauty. <br>  <br> He was a true Renaissance man: a lifelong reader, always with his head in a book, but also an avid gardener. For many years he practiced yoga regularly. He made toys for his children and most of the furniture for his family, taught himself leatherwork, loved philosophical and political discussions, music, swimming, tennis, and cooking, and was a staunch Democrat, making sure to vote, by absentee ballot, even during his last illness. <br>  <br> He leaves behind Gladys, his loving wife of 63 years; daughters Josna Rege, in Amherst and Sally Rege Carroll, in North Reading, Massachusetts; grandsons Nikhil, in New York City, and Tyler, also from North Reading, currently studying at UMass Amherst; sisters Kumud Rege and Sunita Kulkarni, and brothers Prabhakar and Sadanand Rege, all in Mumbai, India; sons-in-law Andrew and Kevin, many loving nieces and nephews, brothers- and sisters-in law, and fast friends in India, England, and the United States. A great loss to us all, but a life well lived. <br>  <br> Beers and Story Belchertown Funeral Home has been entrusted with the arrangements.", "flag": 1, "real_time": "07:22PM", "real_date": "28-09-2016", "read_more": 1}, {"source": "The Scholar\"s Avenue", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/scholarsavenue/photos/a.294184150131.193021.156819310131/10154446039510132/?type=3", "id": "156819310131_10154446039510132", "created_time": "2016-09-28T13:26:26+0000", "short_message": "Technology Transfer Group, IIT Kharagpur is conducting a patent drive, the launch event  to which will be held on 29th September 2016 in SN Bose Auditorium.", "message": "Technology Transfer Group, IIT Kharagpur is conducting a patent drive, the launch event  to which will be held on 29th September 2016 in SN Bose Auditorium.

Despite the introduction of several savings and alternative measures like replacement of traditional halogen street lamps with LED, sensor operated lights and installation of solar panels, this sharp upswing whereas can be attributed to an increase in research facilities and functioning of four new halls viz. RLB, LBS, BRH & NVH; it cannot be ruled out completely that the misuse and wastage do not have a colossal rise. The hall and department wise data obtained from the Electric Office unveils that the consumption has increased drastically in almost every hall and department. <br> Many a times we are seen to leave the lights and fans running while we go to the class; not because of our unwillingness but because of our carelessness. We should always remember that there are still 19,706 villages in our India (Data as of 2015, Census Board, Ministry of Home Affairs, Govt. of India) which remain un-electrified even after 69 years of our independence.
