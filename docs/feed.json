Just like a band-aid, we can fabricate a dia-aid that can be used by diabetic patients for painless insulin administration. Though we cannot bring down the cost of insulin, the patch can reduce the device cost by 50%.\u201d <br> Further commenting on the durability of the needles, Richa Mishra, Ph.D. scholar at the institute and first author of the work says, \u201cWe found that the new carbon microneedles overcame the resistive forces of our skin and was able to successfully pierce the skin. And as the needles are only 400 micrometers long, it will be completely painless. \u201d <br>  <br> Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur congratulates the team for their success. <br> https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/carbon-microneedles-low-cost-painless-injections/article25920342.ece?fbclid=IwAR2vm3qsOT0y-No1DaTbm8QgsmAVbc4uQyOrqt0VZVxiUyAFMznMcqJ1MPo"}, {"link": "https://www.facebook.com/iitkgp.tech/photos/a.741165312597053/2065754033471501/?type=3", "created_time": "2019-01-06T08:54:17+0000", "real_date": "06-01-2019", "flag": 1, "short_message": "Open IIT Blockchain 2019 <br>  <br> PS Release Date: 7th January 12:00 AM <br> Report Submission Deadline: 14th January 11:59 PM <br> Max.

The research clearly revealed the emergence of ozone recovery even at the altitudes where the near-complete ozone loss occurs. <br> The study was conducted by Prof Jayanarayanan Kuttippurath along with Pankaj Kumar, Prijitha J Nair, and PC Pandey from the Centre of Oceans, Rivers, Atmosphere and Land Science (CORAL), IIT Kharagpur.

Although the grant for Prime Minister Research Fellows (PMRFs) is considerably higher (INR 70,000 monthly) but they are very less in number. Currently, the Junior Research Fellows (JRFs) receive a fellowship grant of INR 25,000 per month while the Senior Research fellows receive 3,000 more.

It is this love we commemorate today as children's day & his legacy we honor\u001b. <br>  <br> Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur wishes everyone a Happy Children's Day. <br>  <br> Don't let the child inside you fade away."}, {"link": "https://www.facebook.com/awaaziitkgp/photos/a.146211918732505/2098849700135374/?type=3", "created_time": "2018-11-13T13:34:05+0000", "short_message": "Most of you might remember security guards for making you cycle through the cycle lanes but admittingly, we need to recognise the efforts they put in for", "id": "146188872068143_2098854806801530", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/46161806_2098849706802040_679075071557369856_o.jpg?_nc_cat=103&_nc_ht=scontent.xx&oh=53cb856295acb4f5af060d2b6674f2db&oe=5C7A5E6D", "source": "Awaaz IIT Kharagpur", "real_time": "07:04PM", "real_date": "13-11-2018", "read_more": 1, "flag": 1, "story": "Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur added 19 new photos \u2014 with Partha P Chakrabarti and 5 others.", "message": "Most of you might remember security guards for making you cycle through the cycle lanes but admittingly, we need to recognise the efforts they put in for our service.

This Saturday, they cleaned Technology Guest House premises. <br> In addition to this, they also conducted a bicycle drive in a nearby village to spread awareness about Gandhiji\u2019s teachings, cleanliness and the effect of drug abuse among the villagers. Cycle Yatra team halted at village Purbapatri and carried out a cleanliness and sanitation drive as part of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.  <br> The inauguration of this drive on Gandhi Jayanti saw the presence of Prof. Partha P Chakrabarti (Director), Prof. S.

S. Jha, Head of the security section, we have got to know about the various measures taken by the security section of IIT Kharagpur to ensure better safety of the students and overall peacefulness on the campus. Some of these measures are: <br> 1) Installation of over a hundred CCTV cameras across the campus including Halls, exit and entry gates, crossover positions like Tikka and many more. This ensures tracking of the happenings on the campus in a better way and enables the security team to spot the situations where emergency measures are needed to be taken. This would help in cases like cycle thefts, inappropriate incidents etc. A proposal of installing extra three times more the CCTV cameras installed right now is underway and is soon to be procured within next one month. Earlier, Awaaz had communicated the need of CCTV cameras in the campus to the authorities based on our survey on Basic Amenities. And we are happy to see this getting implemented.  <br> 2) Formation of Quick Response Teams (QRTs). There are 4 sets of QRT teams strolling around campus all the time and students, in case of any emergency, can call them 24 x 7 and they would be there to help you out within two to three minutes. QRT team is equipped with motorbikes and wireless sets. QRTs can be called on two numbers: 03222-281002, 03222-281003 <br> 3) Entry Passes for non-IIT students and staffs. Non IIT members now have to take a three month valid entry pass in order to cross through the campus. Once the validity is over, they need to renew the same. Without getting their entry passes checked, they can't go through the gates.  <br> 4) More Wireless sets to security personnel. More than four dozens of Wireless sets have been procured and distributed to security personnel to enable effective communication and hence, quicker actions. <br> 5) Proposal of Women Cell. A proposal for having Women QRT teams and more women security personnel is underway.  <br>  <br> Besides beefing up the security, they have also been actively involved in smooth conduction of Illumination, Durga Puja celebrations and other events happening in the campus. This, for sure, indicates that the security measures have been strengthen over recent months and we hope that it\u2019s going to get better in future."}, {"link": "https://www.facebook.com/awaaziitkgp/photos/a.146211918732505/2094449507242060/?type=3", "created_time": "2018-11-10T05:27:23+0000", "short_message": "Our newsletter for the month of November is out, and apart from our regular columns, it offers to you the information about highly exciting offers and", "id": "146188872068143_2094449763908701", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/45954240_2094449513908726_4732459210300719104_o.jpg?_nc_cat=107&_nc_ht=scontent.xx&oh=0d82535c66b82506ce647a9470a03154&oe=5C738254", "source": "Awaaz IIT Kharagpur", "real_time": "10:57AM", "real_date": "10-11-2018", "read_more": 1, "flag": 1, "story": "Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur added 2 new photos.", "message": "Our newsletter for the month of November is out, and apart from our regular columns, it offers to you the information about highly exciting offers and coupon codes from Kaizing.

They told me that to take one time(single)   policy from Exide Life insurance which would be as like as bank FD and I would get Rs. 24000/- PM as interest. They told me that it could be encash anytime whenever I wish as like as bank FD. <br>  <br> They added that to inform them when I would received my one time policy bond at my residence and that should be kept in their custody/Exide branch without cutting that one time policy/FD bond's envelope  to process my interest@24000/-pm.  <br>  <br> And as per their advice I had handed over my 4 nos of above one time policy/FD bond (Sealed envelope)  to Baburam Mahapatra when I had received it without cutting all envelope. <br>  <br> When I had not received any interest which they had committed to me Rs.24000/-pm since this long time (6 months time) then I discussed with my family and friends regarding their forgery. My family and friends told me that I had been cheated by Baburam Mahapatra and also I come to know that several senior citizens people have been cheated by them. <br>  <br> I requested them several times to return back my all one time policy/FD bond to me but all time they said that my interest@24000/-pm was in process at HO and all my bond were required for it. They also told me that it would take time (4-5 months) initially and I would get accumulated interest (4-5 months) in my bank account and all one time bond all together.  <br>  <br> When I shouted them that time Baburam Mahapatra have given me 4 nos of above my policy/FD bond by the first week of previous  month  and I become faint by seeing of this said bond. <br>  <br> I found that all of above said one time Exide life policy bond(which they said)  are recurring policies like LIC which I have to pay for that said term else all policies will be lapsed on 2nd year onwards. <br> I have not a single paise to pay premium on 2nd year, I had invested all my savings at Exide life Insurance  as per Baburam Mahapatra's commitment that I would get interest@24000/- pm. <br>  <br> Policy details are mentioned below: <br>  <br> 1.Policy No:  03747862 Rs.: 750000/- for 10 years premium payment term.  <br>  <br> 2. Policy No: 03747894 Rs: 750000/- for 10 years premium payment term. <br>  <br> 3. Policy No: 03780492 Rs: 48000/- for 5 years premium payment term and maturity at 15 years. <br>  <br> 4. Policy No: 03780493 Rs. 500000/-for 5 years premium payment term and maturity at 20 years. <br>  <br> Baburam Mahapatra had taken my above amount Rs.:2048000/- which I have earned from my retirement benefit and that i had kept in my bank as FD. He told me that Exide Life has started banking business and people could invest here as bank Fixed deposit (one time) and interest (10-12%) would be credited in my bank account in monthly basis. <br>  <br> I come to know that Baburam Mahapatra  is a big culprit and big cheater who are cheating every senior citizens people by sitting at  Exide life Golpark branch, Kolkata  office day to day. And Exide life insurance  are supporting his all fraudulent activities. He can do all this fraudulent activities by getting support from his bosses. They have a good understanding with each other regarding agents/employee's payout which they are taking day to day. This is very very unfortunate that Exide life insurance such a IRDA listed company are recruiting such fraud, cheater people like Baburam Mahapatra and have given such a senior label position like Branch Manager. Every common people like me should trust a Branch Manager of a listed co. <br>  <br> After taking 30 days of time customers care people  mailed that they would  not cancel my above policies.  Mr Joydeep Banerjee called me,  i told him that your fraud employee Baburam Mahapatra cheated me by getting support from Exide co. He had taken all bonds (in sealed envelope position) when that i received. And he returned all bonds first week of previous  month. I couldn't check their terms and conditions which they are telling now, Baburam Mahapatra intentionally done it, he knew that i must cancel all bonds if i able to see their terms & conditions that time when i received that.  <br>  <br> BABURAM MAHAPATRA DIDN'T GIVE ME SCOPE FOR CANCELLATION AT FREE LOOK PERIOD.  <br>  <br> I am a retired person (63 years old) & got above all money as retirement benefit and had kept in bank (FD) & was getting interest from bank per month for which I was maintaining my family. <br>  <br> Now I am totally helpless and not have a single paise to buy medicines for me and my wife. We are heart patient and have high blood sugar and high blood pressure. <br>  <br> Without any medical test Exide Life Insurance issued my all policies. They did false medical where as me and my spouse is heart patient. All information in bond are false. This all things happened by Baburam Mahapatra without taking my consent.  <br>  <br> I write to request to arrange for cancellation  above all policies and kindly refund my money Rs: 2048000/- and obliged.  <br>  <br> Yours faithfully, <br>  <br> Dilip Kumar Dutta"}, {"link": "https://www.facebook.com/awaaziitkgp/photos/a.146211918732505/2090590214294656/?type=3", "created_time": "2018-11-07T05:27:08+0000", "real_date": "07-11-2018", "flag": 1, "short_message": "Deepawali, 'a row of lights', a festival celebrated with fervorous gaiety, is the period of time to attain full inner illumination and inexhaustible spiritual", "id": "146188872068143_2090590850961259", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/45539875_2090590217627989_1755995424759480320_o.jpg?_nc_cat=107&_nc_ht=scontent.xx&oh=b873fa3db9ecf255fee6befa9632bd64&oe=5C3DF6D9", "read_more": 1, "source": "Awaaz IIT Kharagpur", "real_time": "10:57AM", "message": "Deepawali, 'a row of lights', a festival celebrated with fervorous gaiety, is the period of time to attain full inner illumination and inexhaustible spiritual wealth of the self.

These sentiments echoed by Malcolm X have been proved many a time. But unfortunately, in recent times media outlets are not dedicated to what they should actually be looking for- ethics and truthfulness. Lots of instances can be cited which suggest that media is running recklessly after sensationalism and profit, which sadly, is directly proportional to how one can engage the common people with a spicy gossip. This has led media tending to report rumors, speculations, and projections as facts and in turn, misleading the major chunk of masses into believing them. <br> A recent news in a leading newspaper daily stating that IITBHU would be providing training to become ideal daughter-in-law shook us. Although the news garnered a lot of mass attention and surely helped the media houses gain its warranted popularity, but at what cost? Defaming an institution of national importance can never be justified on grounds of a false news. IIT BHU director had to convene a meeting with the top officials regarding the news and the institute has sent the clarification to all the media houses. A startup which was incubated at IIT BHU was taking some steps and the reporter thought it necessary to highlight it as an IIT BHU initiative so as to get the attention of masses. (Link to the report:  <a href='https://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-we-are-not-offering-an-ideal-daughter-in-law-course-iit-bhu-rejects-report-2659438' target='_blank'> https://www.dnaindia.com/... </a> ) <br> IITs, being the premier institutes of India, have been a sought-after topic of news reporting for the media. The status of IITs as mere screening institutes for providing jobs after a few years of study has been created thanks to media highlighting only about the highly paid jobs here. The hype that has been created around IITs being such institutes have cost the nation its research potential and reputation has been compromised. It's high time that we stand against such ways of news reporting and believe in constructive journalism."}, {"link": "https://www.facebook.com/awaaziitkgp/photos/a.146211918732505/2006903479329997/?type=3", "created_time": "2018-09-05T05:19:57+0000", "real_date": "05-09-2018", "flag": 1, "short_message": "'One child, one teacher, one pen and one book can change the world', a quote by an activist for women education and the daughter of a teacher, Malala Yousafzai.", "id": "146188872068143_2006904545996557", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/40771177_2006903482663330_2176258966810525696_n.jpg?_nc_cat=0&oh=a4368ec0ebdc74175414e90ce5dc497c&oe=5C31296D", "read_more": 1, "source": "Awaaz IIT Kharagpur", "real_time": "10:49AM", "message": "'One child, one teacher, one pen and one book can change the world', a quote by an activist for women education and the daughter of a teacher, Malala Yousafzai. <br>  <br> Rightly so, a teacher constantly fights to bring out the best in his students.

Due to a staggering turnout of less than 10%, the event had to be postponed by at least half an hour, when the quorum was finally met. The first session, 'Motivational Lecture-II' had Dr Era Dutta, a consultant, neuropsychiatrist, therapist, and a life coach from Kolkata involving the students in an interactive talk about Success and Depression. With statistics and examples, the students explored the pervasive traits of depression, its correspondence with success and its cure, the happiness. 'Happiness is the whole pie and we are focusing only on success which is just a small chunk. Why not focus on the whole pie?', she said. The session thus ended with her advice to this post-millennial audience, which was to keep chanting a happiness mantra, 'Today was a good day.' <br>   <br> By 7:15, the strength has already increased to about 300 for the latter event of the day, 'Carrer Workshop-2' conducted by the External Relations Cell and the CDC. In continuation to the CV filling workshop of last week, this session involved an insight into various opportunities available for an undergraduate student at IIT Kharagpur. Four sectors viz., Higher Studies, Public Sector, Corporate Sector, and Entrepreneurship sector were discussed. Students were given a rough outline of how it is to choose one of them and implement accordingly a set of plans, internships to do and courses to undertake.

It was then followed by the description of upcoming Inter IIT competitions by the Gymkhana representatives. The Inter IIT Cultural, Sports and Technology student representatives explained students about the details of all these areas and possible ways to explore them. <br> The second program of the day conducted by the External Relations Cell received a great response from the students' side. The program 'How to build a CV ' and 'Understanding GDs and Pis' mainly focused on the different fields that come under a CV. It gave a brief idea about how to build a CV including the do's and don'ts while formulating the CV.  <br> The final program 'Student Welfare Portfolio' described a typical life of a  student when in mental pressure and a friend's role in his or her life. <br> Awaaz encourages second years students to participate in these programmes and make the most out of it. <br> If you still have any queries regarding the Assimilation program, you can visit here.  <a href='https://medium.com/@awaazofiitkgp/assimilation-program-insights-faqs-a64d55a2fa9b' target='_blank'> https://medium.com/@awaaz... </a> "}, {"link": "https://www.facebook.com/scholarsavenue/photos/a.294184150131.193021.156819310131/10156389110550132/?type=3", "created_time": "2018-07-29T17:33:10+0000", "short_message": "Day 1 | Phase 2 | Assimilation Programme <br>  <br> The second phase of Day 1 of the Assimilation Programme 2018 had the ExR cell and the SWG taking over", "id": "156819310131_10156389110945132", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/37987875_10156389110555132_4555764616520531968_o.jpg?_nc_cat=0&oh=63a6dfed1fdca24ab76c7785e535c3cd&oe=5BD0D220", "source": "The Scholar\"s Avenue", "real_time": "11:03PM", "real_date": "29-07-2018", "read_more": 1, "flag": 1, "story": "The Scholars' Avenue added 3 new photos.", "message": "Day 1 | Phase 2 | Assimilation Programme <br>  <br> The second phase of Day 1 of the Assimilation Programme 2018 had the ExR cell and the SWG taking over the stage of Kalidas Auditorium to conduct some interesting and useful workshops.

Nagarjun played an active role in movements prior to the Emergency period in 1975-77 and masses hailed his views that were mostly rebellious of those in power. <br>  <br> \u201c\u092c\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0942\u0915\u0947\u0902 \u0939\u0940 \u0939\u0941\u0908\u0902 \u0906\u091c \u092e\u093e\u0927\u094d\u092f\u092e \u0936\u093e\u0938\u0928 \u0915\u093e <br> \u0917\u094b\u0932\u0940 \u0939\u0940 \u092a\u0930\u094d\u092f\u093e\u092f \u092c\u0928 \u0917\u0908 \u0939\u0948 \u0930\u093e\u0936\u0928 \u0915\u093e\u201d <br>                      -\u092e\u094b\u0930 \u0928 \u0939\u094b\u0917\u093e...\u0909\u0932\u094d\u0932\u0942 \u0939\u094b\u0902\u0917\u0947 <br>  <br> Nagarjun was given the Sahitya Akademi Award in 1969 for his historic book Patarheen Nagna Gachh, and the 'Bharat Bharati Award' by the Uttar Pradesh government for his literary contributions in 1983.

Speculations included daily/weekly limit on data usage, attempt to track down the nature of data usage etc. We contacted Head (CIC) over these speculations and found out that none of these are true. <br> As per Head (CIC), there is no change in usage policy in terms of data limit and time of usage. It would be same as it has been till now. Currently, it will just require you to authenticate into the Wi-Fi network so that only valid users are allowed to use it. However, there will be a limit on the no. of devices connected at any one point of time from a single user id so that the user id is not misused. The limit will be reasonable given that a student may have multiple devices like laptop, 1-2 phones etc., and there will be this device limit for all including faculty and staff, not just students. Right now, CIC has enabled the authentication so that the IIT community starts using it and they will consider the feedbacks before they finally make the entire Wi-Fi access authenticated. This is why they have not turned off the non-authenticated SSIDs now. They will give sufficient notice to the entire IIT community before the whole Wi-Fi becomes authenticated.  <br> As for the concerns over tracking down the nature of data usage, he said that the IIT network is for everyone's academic and reasonable personal use only. CIC does not track the nature of data usage and this authentication process does not change that policy, but users should not indulge in misusing the Wi-Fi network for illegitimate purposes. A general guideline of usage can be found in the Policies link of  <a href='http://www.cic.iitkgp.ac.in' target='_blank'> www.cic.iitkgp.ac.in </a> .  <br>  <br> Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur encourages the students on campus to start using this authentication and report problems to CIC and provide them with feedbacks."}, {"link": null, "created_time": "2018-06-22T04:21:54+0000", "real_date": "22-06-2018", "flag": 1, "short_message": "Here's an important update regarding Wi-Fi facility on the campus. <br> Wi-Fi access inside IIT Kharagpur is soon going to require user authentication.", "id": "146188872068143_1888548587832154", "pic": null, "read_more": 1, "source": "Awaaz IIT Kharagpur", "real_time": "09:51AM", "message": "Here's an important update regarding Wi-Fi facility on the campus. <br> Wi-Fi access inside IIT Kharagpur is soon going to require user authentication.

Users are requested to start connecting to the secured SSIDs following the procedure below to access the wi-fi network.  <br>  <br> 1. Your user id is your ERP login.  <br>  <br> 2. To create your network access password, log in to your ERP account, and follow the link 'Set Campus Network Password' under the link for 'Home'. Set a password you will use for network access (should be different from your ERP password). You can change the password anytime again in the same manner.  <br>  <br> 3. Configure your device for wi-fi authentication. Step by step instructions for different OS (Android/Windows/Linux/Mac) can be found in the 'Wi-Fi Authentication' link in  <a href='http://www.cic.iitkgp.ac.in' target='_blank'> http://www.cic.iitkgp.ac.... </a> . Normally, you will have to do this configuration only once per secured SSID unless you change your password or want to login with some other user id.  <br>  <br> 4. Connect to the corresponding SSID.  <br>  <br> Please note the following:  <br>  <br> 1. Normally, you may need 10-15 seconds for connection the first time you configure, please be patient.  <br>  <br> 2. Faculty/Staff may share their password with their family members for wi-fi access. However, in order to avoid password misuse, there will be a limit for no. of simultaneous connections. Please note that the user with the user id is responsible for any misuse of the wi-fi network when connected with the user id.  <br>  <br> Note that for now the current non-secured SSIDs will stay open until further notice for wi-fi access by people with no ERP account such as guests, visitors, contractual staff needing access for their work etc. The policies for these classes of users and access methods will be circulated soon by CIC.  <br>  <br> However, users with ERP accounts are strongly advised to start using the secured SSIDs immediately and report any problems to CIC; the non-secured SSIDs will be withdrawn soon. <br>  <br> -CIC Support Team"}, {"link": "https://opensource.googleblog.com/2018/06/google-summer-of-code-2018-statistics-part-2.html", "created_time": "2018-06-21T17:50:56+0000", "real_date": "21-06-2018", "flag": 1, "short_message": "While Google Summer of Code is in full swing now, Google has released some interesting stats for GSoC'18.  <br> IIT Kharagpur stands 4th globally with", "id": "524856034258068_1747171222026537", "pic": null, "read_more": 1, "source": "Kharagpur Open Source Society", "real_time": "11:20PM", "message": "While Google Summer of Code is in full swing now, Google has released some interesting stats for GSoC'18.  <br> IIT Kharagpur stands 4th globally with 22 students selected this year.

It is focussing more on Indian classical music and musical instruments and has an ongoing collaboration with Pandit Ajoy Chakraborty in this field. Currently, IIT Kharagpur is providing training in music, fine arts, and the performing arts, and also is offering credit courses in the form of electives and micro- specializations. The center will also create national and international outreach programmes for dissemination and collaborative research on science and technology interventions in Indian classical music and arts. IIT Kharagpur intends to begin research on classic musical instruments to bring in innovative materials and processes to optimize cost and time on the making of instruments like sitar and sarod. The main motive behind all this is to create a deeper understanding of social values among the students and preserve the national heritage of the country. <br>  <br> Source:  <a href='https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/education/iitians-to-get-lessons-in-fine-arts-humanities/articleshow/64229799.cms?from=mdr' target='_blank'> https://economictimes.ind... </a> "}, {"link": "https://www.facebook.com/TeamKART/photos/a.178183998897724.36486.138694869513304/1601036696612440/?type=3", "created_time": "2018-05-21T11:41:13+0000", "real_date": "21-05-2018", "flag": 1, "short_message": "Work ethics 101: Keep your workspace clean and organized. <br>  <br> #TeamKARTbay <br> #fsa", "id": "138694869513304_1601039363278840", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/33058883_1601036699945773_7300766807684546560_o.jpg?_nc_cat=0&oh=def5e12fee6cbab81633e6ae432dcac2&oe=5BBB0EFC", "read_more": null, "source": "TeamKART", "real_time": "05:11PM", "message": "Work ethics 101: Keep your workspace clean and organized. <br>  <br> #TeamKARTbay <br> #fsae"}, {"link": "https://www.facebook.com/TeamKART/photos/a.178183998897724.36486.138694869513304/1601036696612440/?type=3", "created_time": "2018-05-21T11:41:13+0000", "real_date": "21-05-2018", "flag": 1, "short_message": "Work ethics 101: Keep your workspace clean and organized. <br>  <br> #TeamKARTbay <br> #fsa", "id": "138694869513304_1601039363278840", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/33058883_1601036699945773_7300766807684546560_o.jpg?_nc_cat=0&oh=e4ff918ac3ccdca2807f3e5748e50503&oe=5B9381FC", "read_more": null, "source": "TeamKART", "real_time": "05:11PM", "message": "Work ethics 101: Keep your workspace clean and organized. <br>  <br> #TeamKARTbay <br> #fsae"}, {"link": "https://www.facebook.com/awaaziitkgp/photos/a.146211918732505.22874.146188872068143/1850022525018094/?type=3", "created_time": "2018-05-20T12:51:02+0000", "short_message": "In a quite shocking and startling revelation, it has been found out that a person who has been heavily followed on social media platforms and claimed himself", "id": "146188872068143_1850026548351025", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/33116201_1850022531684760_2767644970985717760_o.jpg?_nc_cat=0&oh=3b005ec6df3baa6f528c129080117908&oe=5B88E492", "source": "Awaaz IIT Kharagpur", "real_time": "06:21PM", "real_date": "20-05-2018", "read_more": 1, "flag": 1, "story": "Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur added 16 new photos.", "message": "In a quite shocking and startling revelation, it has been found out that a person who has been heavily followed on social media platforms and claimed himself to be an IIT KGP mechanical graduate everywhere, is not actually a KGPian and he has duped many people of large sums of money including many KGPians. Mr. Niladri Sarkar had claimed himself to pursue MS at Mechanical Engineering Department of IIT KGP and having worked as External Research Associate in the Fluid Dynamics Lab of MIT. He also claimed to be pursuing research at IIT Madras and IIT Bombay at different point of times. A few months ago, when he was in KGP campus, he started approaching faculty members stating that he is an alumnus of IIT KGP and he is willing to collaborate with them for his MIT Project. However, when he was confronted by one of our alumni, Dr. Kaushik Mukherjee on sensing a foul play, he took down most of these claims from social media. Upon contacting the concerned MIT professor, it was also found out that his MIT claim was totally fake. He social engineered his way into IIT KGP. He started adding IITians (and KGPians) to his friend list. Upon seeing a lot of mutual friends, the other students added him. He then approached the junior batches posing himself as an alumnus who was visiting the college on the pretext of meeting some professors and doing research. Many students on the campus got swayed by his claims and his online activities. The students somehow thought of Mr. Niladri Sarkar as a great academician, probably all due to his Quora popularity! And this is why the students were generous enough to lend him money as and whenever he requested. He asked many students for money stating his poor financial conditions and most of them did lend him money which hasn\u2019t been returned yet. The amount that has been taken by him from the students sums up to be a hefty amount.  <br> The following were the claims of Mr. Niladri Sarkar: <br> 1) Mr. Sarkar claims himself to be an IIT KGP student in both his Facebook ( <a href='https://www.facebook.com/niladri.sarkar.3701' target='_blank'> https://www.facebook.com/... </a> ) and Quora ( <a href='https://www.quora.com/profile/Niladri-Sarkar-5' target='_blank'> https://www.quora.com/pro... </a> ) profiles which is false. <br> 2) He pursued MS under the supervision of Prof. P. K. Das, Department of Mechanical Engineering. We confirmed it from the professor and he denied knowing any such student under his guidance. <br> 3) He has an Institute ID card which does not look like the regular ones that we have. <br> 4) He claims to have three research papers none of which are available online since they are done in collaboration with DRDO and AIIMS. These research papers are available within IIT Council, that\u2019s what he has told some people. <br> 5) A mail from Prof. Indranil Manna, Director, IIT Kanpur praising his research works. <br> 6) The Research Quality Index certificate stating that he scored 100/100 in research and obtained an AIR 1. This certificate is claimed to be issued jointly by IIT Kanpur. According to him, this certificate is issued once in five years. However, we weren\u2019t able to find out any such Index or program being organised by any IIT or IISc. <br> 7) Interaction with Prof. S. K. Dash, Head, Department of Mechanical Engineering and other Professors of the department in Nalanda Class Room Complex.  <br> 8 ) The offer of direct PhD studentship from Prof. Pradip Dutta, Professor and Chair, Department of Mechanical Engineering, IISc. <br> 9) A mail from Dean MIT expressing their willingness to participate in the Indian Research Quality Index Conference which is going to be organised by him at IIT Kharagpur. No such conference took place in reality. <br> 10) Selection as External Research Associate in Fluid Dynamics Lab of MIT under the supervision of Prof. John Bush. Upon contacting Prof. Bush regarding the validity of the report, the document was found to be fraudulent. Prof. Bush denied having any such student under his supervision <br> 11) A nice conversation with Prof. Souvik Bhattacharyya, Senior Professor and Vice-Chancellor, BITS Pilani. <br>  12) Telephonic interaction with Prof. Amitabha Ghosh, former Director of IIT KGP <br> 13) The evaluation report of MIT Fluid Dynamics Lab.  <br> 14) There is also one online article ( <a href='https://www.kenfolios.com/dont-topper-successful-proved-style/' target='_blank'> https://www.kenfolios.com... </a> ) wherein he was claimed to be KGPian. <br> Most of these claims have been found false. Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur requests all the students to beware of such people including him and do not get swayed by any kind of unauthentic claims. We, as a unit, need to be safe from such elements and take care so that such incidents do not occur. Stay alert, stay cautious!

Upon contacting the concerned MIT professor, it was also found out that his MIT claim was totally fake. He social engineered his way into IIT KGP. He started adding IITians (and KGPians) to his friend list. Upon seeing a lot of mutual friends, the other students added him. He then approached the junior batches posing himself as an alumnus who was visiting the college on the pretext of meeting some professors and doing research. Many students on the campus got swayed by his claims and his online activities. The students somehow thought of Mr. Niladri Sarkar as a great academician, probably all due to his Quora popularity! And this is why the students were generous enough to lend him money as and whenever he requested. He asked many students for money stating his poor financial conditions and most of them did lend him money which hasn\u2019t been returned yet. The amount that has been taken by him from the students sums up to be a hefty amount.  <br> The following were the claims of Mr. Niladri Sarkar: <br> 1) Mr. Sarkar claims himself to be an IIT KGP student in both his Facebook ( <a href='https://www.facebook.com/niladri.sarkar.3701' target='_blank'> https://www.facebook.com/... </a> ) and Quora ( <a href='https://www.quora.com/profile/Niladri-Sarkar-5' target='_blank'> https://www.quora.com/pro... </a> ) profiles which is false. <br> 2) He pursued MS under the supervision of Prof. P. K. Das, Department of Mechanical Engineering. We confirmed it from the professor and he denied knowing any such student under his guidance. <br> 3) He has an Institute ID card which does not look like the regular ones that we have. <br> 4) He claims to have three research papers none of which are available online since they are done in collaboration with DRDO and AIIMS. These research papers are available within IIT Council, that\u2019s what he has told some people. <br> 5) A mail from Prof. Indranil Manna, Director, IIT Kanpur praising his research works. <br> 6) The Research Quality Index certificate stating that he scored 100/100 in research and obtained an AIR 1. This certificate is claimed to be issued jointly by IIT Kanpur. According to him, this certificate is issued once in five years. However, we weren\u2019t able to find out any such Index or program being organised by any IIT or IISc. <br> 7) Interaction with Prof. S. K. Dash, Head, Department of Mechanical Engineering and other Professors of the department in Nalanda Class Room Complex.  <br> 8. The offer of direct PhD studentship from Prof. Pradip Dutta, Professor and Chair, Department of Mechanical Engineering, IISc. <br> 9) A mail from Dean MIT expressing their willingness to participate in the Indian Research Quality Index Conference which is going to be organised by him at IIT Kharagpur. No such conference took place in reality. <br> 10) Selection as External Research Associate in Fluid Dynamics Lab of MIT under the supervision of Prof. John Bush. Upon contacting Prof. Bush regarding the validity of the report, the document was found to be fraudulent. Prof. Bush denied having any such student under his supervision <br> 11) A nice conversation with Prof. Souvik Bhattacharyya, Senior Professor and Vice-Chancellor, BITS Pilani. <br>  12) Telephonic interaction with Prof. Amitabha Ghosh, former Director of IIT KGP <br> 13) The evaluation report of MIT Fluid Dynamics Lab.  <br> 14) There is also one online article ( <a href='https://www.kenfolios.com/dont-topper-successful-proved-style/' target='_blank'> https://www.kenfolios.com... </a> ) wherein he was claimed to be KGPian. <br> Most of these claims have been found false. Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur requests all the students to beware of such people including him and do not get swayed by any kind of unauthentic claims. We, as a unit, need to be safe from such elements and take care so that such incidents do not occur. Stay alert, stay cautious! Here\u2019re the relevant pictures including the claims that he has now been taken down."}, {"link": "https://www.facebook.com/awaaziitkgp/photos/a.146211918732505.22874.146188872068143/1848998688453811/?type=3", "created_time": "2018-05-19T12:21:48+0000", "real_date": "19-05-2018", "flag": 1, "short_message": "Homecoming 2018, a reunion for the batch of 1998, 2003 and 2008, is going to be organized at IIT Kharagpur from 17th to 19th August 2018 by Alumni Cell,", "id": "146188872068143_1848998688453811", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/33026530_1848998695120477_3290767868764880896_o.jpg?_nc_cat=0&oh=8666dd9f1f2db244dcd52c1e7fd43c3b&oe=5B82833B", "read_more": 1, "source": "Awaaz IIT Kharagpur", "real_time": "05:51PM", "message": "Homecoming 2018, a reunion for the batch of 1998, 2003 and 2008, is going to be organized at IIT Kharagpur from 17th to 19th August 2018 by Alumni Cell, IIT Kharagpur.

The poem is a part of the Nobel winning work \u2018Gitanjali\u2019, a collection of poems, by Rabindranath Tagore.  <br> Rabindranath Tagore was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in the year 1913 becoming the first Asian to be honoured with the Nobel. Along with being a renowned poet, he was also a writer, novelist, visual artist, composer, playwright, and a philosopher. His works influenced a wide range of Indians during the freedom struggle. Such was the impact of his works that two of his compositions were chosen by India and Bangladesh as their National Anthems. Tagore always stayed away from the concept of separatist nationalism and urged the people to get over the narrow differences of casteism and other social evils.  <br> On his 157th birth anniversary, paying tribute to the revolutionary thinker, we hope that his ideas of freedom will be realised deeply as our nation progresses."}, {"link": "https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10216636572050534&set=p.10216636572050534&type=3", "created_time": "2018-05-07T08:18:13+0000", "real_date": "07-05-2018", "flag": 1, "short_message": "Please send your CVs at careers@unmask.in", "id": "149405445074499_2096086363739721", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/31969946_10216636572130536_48922134222733312_o.jpg?_nc_cat=0&oh=a85d3873660b2b71aab95f9ea4d9c6d9&oe=5B84C0BD", "read_more": null, "source": "Technology Students Gymkhana", "real_time": "01:48PM", "message": "Please send your CVs at careers@unmask.in."}, {"link": "https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10216636571250514&set=p.10216636571250514&type=3", "created_time": "2018-05-07T08:17:53+0000", "real_date": "07-05-2018", "flag": 1, "short_message": "Please send your CVs at careers@unmask.in", "id": "149405445074499_2096086173739740", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/32076788_10216636571290515_3961174695591542784_o.jpg?_nc_cat=0&oh=41f557f19c9767fccdceed7157199b35&oe=5B8F0201", "read_more": null, "source": "Technology Students Gymkhana", "real_time": "01:47PM", "message": "Please send your CVs at careers@unmask.in."}, {"link": "https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10216636570370492&set=p.10216636570370492&type=3", "created_time": "2018-05-07T08:17:30+0000", "real_date": "07-05-2018", "flag": 1, "short_message": "Please send your CVs at careers@unmask.in", "id": "149405445074499_2096085970406427", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/31957102_10216636570410493_858757403502444544_o.jpg?_nc_cat=0&oh=30dc3ac3b3eb4e6d657009041d7a30a5&oe=5B8D2DFC", "read_more": null, "source": "Technology Students Gymkhana", "real_time": "01:47PM", "message": "Please send your CVs at careers@unmask.in."}, {"link": "https://www.facebook.com/awaaziitkgp/photos/a.146211918732505.22874.146188872068143/1835643076456039/?type=3", "created_time": "2018-05-06T09:46:01+0000", "real_date": "06-05-2018", "flag": 1, "short_message": "Charles Dickens once said, \u201cThere is nothing in the world so irresistibly contagious as laughter and good humour.\u201d   <br> Through humour, you can soften", "id": "146188872068143_1835646006455746", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/31960403_1835643086456038_6513525179505704960_o.jpg?_nc_cat=0&oh=e2c9bec77cb41519186f22b4f8c706a1&oe=5B975737", "read_more": 1, "source": "Awaaz IIT Kharagpur", "real_time": "03:16PM", "message": "Charles Dickens once said, \u201cThere is nothing in the world so irresistibly contagious as laughter and good humour.\u201d   <br> Through humour, you can soften some of the worst blows that life delivers.

One of them didn't submit their contact details so we couldn't even reach them to let them know and hence had to take the next highest scorer present. We later got to know that there were two-three people who didn't want to see if they could qualify and didn't submit their answer sheet for checking, where it turned out that they would've actually qualified for the finals. The team that won actually had a member like that, who after giving up, decided to go to his room, from where he had to be called to come back for the finals and eventually won. The finals itself was a cliffhanger with the podium places getting decided in the last two questions of the quiz. <br>  <br> Furthermore, there were no women in attendance. An event, that has no barriers to entry, and no prerequisites for taking part, as well as cash prizes and refreshments where non-regulars to QC sessions turned up and performed very well had an entire section of our campus population giving it a miss in participation definitely speaks volumes about this. We invite discussion regarding this in the comments section, and more than discussion, ideas to improve this situation, considering that Quiz Club has brought laurels for the institute in multiple places throughout the past years and their current Quiz Week initiative is an attempt to lure in people who don't consider themselves knowledgeable enough. <br>  <br> Final Results: <br>  <br> First: B.

The child's father is employed as a daily wage labourer, while her mother works as a domestic help in the houses nearby.  <br> Chhutki needs extensive medical support, and The Quint, in association with BitGiving, has launched a crowdfunding campaign for the infant that can support the poor family through the tough times. <br> Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur appeals to the students, faculty, and staff of IIT Kharagpur to contribute their bit so that Chhutki may lead a life of dignity after she gets well.  <br> #HelpChhutki Win This Fight <br>  <br> To contribute to crowdfunding, Please visit:  <a href='https://www.bitgiving.com/chhutki' target='_blank'> https://www.bitgiving.com... </a>  or  <a href='https://www.thequint.com/news/india/8-month-old-raped-in-delhi-donate-to-help?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=smugglr&utm_campaign=HelpChhutki&utm_term=facebook%20bot' target='_blank'> https://www.thequint.com/... </a> "}, {"link": "https://www.facebook.com/scholarsavenue/photos/a.10153179187290132.1073741854.156819310131/10156000489075132/?type=3", "created_time": "2018-02-23T12:33:41+0000", "real_date": "23-02-2018", "flag": 1, "short_message": "This is to inform that this year's Kharagpur open will take place on the 3rd and 4th of March. <br> Anyone interested is allowed to take part", "id": "156819310131_10156000489110132", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/28164446_10156000489075132_7942701824347317798_o.jpg?oh=cefb9f027bdd0d45ffeb23f2c282cb0b&oe=5B02D632", "read_more": null, "source": "The Scholar\"s Avenue", "real_time": "06:03PM", "message": "This is to inform that this year's Kharagpur open will take place on the 3rd and 4th of March. <br> Anyone interested is allowed to take part."}, {"link": "http://www.pmrf.in/", "created_time": "2018-02-23T11:00:00+0000", "real_date": "23-02-2018", "flag": 1, "short_message": "As promised in the Union Budget 2018 in what can be considered to be a significant step in promoting research in premier institutions of the country, the", "id": "146188872068143_1755621677791513", "pic": null, "read_more": 1, "source": "Awaaz IIT Kharagpur", "real_time": "04:30PM", "message": "As promised in the Union Budget 2018 in what can be considered to be a significant step in promoting research in premier institutions of the country, the application forms for the Prime Minister Research Fellowship will be available on the newly launched portal  <a href='http://www.pmrf.in' target='_blank'> www.pmrf.in </a>  from 24th February 2018. <br>  <br> Selected Candidates will be offered admission to Ph.D. program in one of IITs/IISc with a fellowship of Rs.70,000/- per month for the first two years, Rs.75,000/- per month for the 3rd year, and Rs.80,000/- per month in the 4th and 5th years.

They upped their ante throughout the tournament and took it to another level when it mattered most.  <br> In a fiercely contested contact sport which has high risks of players getting injured, the standard team size used to be 11 and the captain had requested for at least 10. But it was reduced to 9 since the administration felt that there is no need of those 2 extra players in a sport which didn\u2019t have prospects of winning a medal. The Woes didn\u2019t stop there. Out of 9 girls selected for the tournament, one of the most key players had to leave due to a medical emergency at her home. They lost their hopes for the tournament with their star player not being able to make it to the matches. Count goes to 8. One more player sustained an injury and couldn\u2019t play. Count goes to 7. One player was in beginning stages and lacked in the experience that it takes to play at bigger stages. Effective count goes to 6. How do you play a sports tournament which requires 5 players and is highly injury prone? Justina Mathew, Ravali Madambakam, Silla Spandana, Saloni Kirdak, Swati Rawat and Remee Patel did the unthinkable! These six players played the entire tournament (5 matches) without having much luxury of getting substitutes. Out of these players, another key player had an injury in her thumb, which was later found to be a fragment fracture. But she didn't give up, she still took the risk and played all the matches. How about that for an example of perseverance? \u201cA basketball team is like the five fingers on your hand. If you can get them all together, you have a fist.\u201d And they proved so. They not only played, they also topped their pool and steamrolled opponent to reach all the way to finals with 4 wins out of 5 matches in their campaign. And along with winning hearts, they did manage to break the stereotype of basketball being the sport of only tall people. They did it all with good dribblers and long distance shooters. <br>  <br> In the first match itself, they were pitted against the hosts IIT Madras. Loud cheering, home supporters, taller players and what not! And guess what? They announced their arrival in style by beating the favourite hosts by 18-16. The team that no one was giving a chance to put up a fight has suddenly started looking threatening. As if that was not enough, their second successive win over IIT (ISM) Dhanbad by 15-8 sent a strong caution to the winds that they were here to stay, compete and win; not just to make up for the numbers. They gathered the momentum and their victory chariot didn\u2019t stop there. In Quarter Finals, they comprehensively dribbled past IIT BHU by 23-19, sending shivers down the spine of opponents. It was an all-important Semi-Final clash with IIT Bombay. Stakes were high and odds were unfavourable but they rose to the occasion and delivered a nasty blow to Bombay\u2019s hopes of going into Finals. It was tie neck to neck until the last moment when KGP got two free shots in the last 10 seconds of the match. The captain committed no mistake in firing them and the second one went in giving KGP a lead of one point. Can you believe that? A team which was being seen as the one participating just for formality and were no believers in them getting into knockout stages was into the finals! In the finals, they screamed, they ran ferociously, they dribbled hard, they threw all they had, they put each iota of energy their muscles could but credit to the opponents, they were simply better that day. As our players admitted, IIT Roorkee deserved the gold medal. Though they lost by 25-44, their entire campaign was studded with brilliant moments \u2013 the moments they can take pride on! It was nothing less than a roller coaster ride for them where they defied their own expectations and proved the pundits wrong. All the practice, hard work and perseverance bore sweet fruits.  <br> It wasn\u2019t their victory alone. It was also a big win for their coach Mr Soumen Mondal who played a pivotal role in motivating the team and strategizing for each match. He believed in them and always reminded them of their potential of getting a podium finish. As the players said, \u201cWithout his strategies, the victory wasn\u2019t possible.\u201d The never-say-die attitude of the team was all he wanted and girls didn\u2019t disappoint him. The captain Remee marshalled her troop well and her leadership was the key to this entire campaign. A huge shout to these amazing girls!  <br> What lies in the future? Most of the current players are graduating out. The team needs enthusiastic and dedicated junior players to fill the boots. As one of the players admitted, even during the practice sessions, participation from juniors was very less. They had a hard time choosing 9 players for the tournament. Participation from girls was utterly disappointing. And if that\u2019s what will keep on going, we don\u2019t stand a chance in rewriting histories in the upcoming Sports Meets. The current players have appealed to the girls to participate in as large numbers as possible. The sports scenario in KGP among girls isn\u2019t in very good shape right now. We needed inspirations to look up to. Now that we have some of them, why to wait? Hit the ground on the very first day of the next semester!"}, {"link": "https://www.facebook.com/TeamKART/photos/a.178183998897724.36486.138694869513304/1459826290733482/?type=3", "created_time": "2017-12-25T03:30:00+0000", "real_date": "25-12-2017", "flag": 1, "short_message": "Ah !

But when will we get there, and how will we get there? <br>   <br> Two terms for the transition have become standard in the auto industry. There's the 'evolutionary' path to autonomous vehicles, where today's cars get self-driving features bit by bit \u2014 Tesla's autopilot feature, for example. And then there's the 'revolutionary' path. That's where totally self-driving cars, like the ones Google is working on, start as test vehicles and become more mainstream as they can drive in more places. <br> There's an ongoing debate over which path is the safer one. But these paths will eventually converge. <br>   <br> Today's most advanced semi-autonomous features can be found in Tesla's and a few other cars that allow drivers to take their hands off the steering wheel on a highway. Using a series of sensors and cameras, cars can also merge, self-park, stay within a lane and brake as needed. <br>   <br> This tech works particularly well for commercial trucks that operate on highways. Companies like Peloton and NXP are 'platooning' trucks \u2014 tying them together through a vehicle-to-vehicle communication system. A 'pilot' truck drives while those behind can sit and relax. <br>  <br> Google and Ford are testing self-driving cars in structured environments like test tracks, as well as cities with relatively light traffic, like Austin, Texas and Mountain View, Calif. Vehicles travel at slow speeds \u2014 up to 25 miles an hour \u2014 while gathering data on pedestrians and human drivers; they are also starting to drive at night, and in rain and snow. <br>   <br> By 2019, Driver-assistance features will get more sophisticated, and will sync up with GPS and navigation. So a driver should be able to input a destination while driving on a highway, turn on adaptive cruise control and let the car drive itself. When it gets to the appropriate exit, the car will return control to the driver. <br>  <br> In the USA, NHTSA (NATIONAL HIGHWAYS TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION) has begun working on rules for testing and deployment of fully autonomous vehicles, without a driver, across the country. In the meantime, companies like Google will be racking up miles to gather data about every single type of situation a self-driving vehicle might encounter; mapping companies will gather as much 3D data in major cities as possible. Car makers and tech companies will have to make sure light detection and ranging (lidar) and radar sensors, as well as cameras and GPS, can work together, while ensuring that each component can function independently if one of them fails <br> . <br> Companies will also be testing vehicles in all climates and environments, including rain and snow. They'll also test cars in more places, moving from test tracks and low-density cities to roads with more foot and vehicle traffic.  <br>   <br> Commercial trucks will likely be the first vehicles to hit the road autonomously, if state and federal regulators give them them the go-ahead to work on highways.  <br>   <br> Here is one such article on the legislation making rounds in the Congress for federal rules on self driving cars to supersede state and local regulations : <br>   <br>  <a href='https://www.wired.com/story/congress-autonomous-self-driving-car-regulations/' target='_blank'> https://www.wired.com/sto... </a> "}, {"link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhGewF4Xyo0&feature=youtu.be", "created_time": "2017-07-02T08:39:19+0000", "short_message": "<b>Metakgp shared Kharagpur Open Source Society - KOSS's post.</b> <br>  <br> Whenever Apple releases a new version of the IPhone, a vast majority of users", "id": "1433721693547904_1858387001081369", "pic": null, "source": "Metakgp", "real_time": "02:09PM", "real_date": "02-07-2017", "read_more": 1, "flag": 1, "story": "Metakgp shared Kharagpur Open Source Society - KOSS's post.", "message": "<b>Metakgp shared Kharagpur Open Source Society - KOSS's post.</b> <br>  <br> Whenever Apple releases a new version of the IPhone, a vast majority of users will flock to buy the current version, although previous versions are still well in use.

Fondly remembered by many students and admirers. <br>  <br> Amherst - Madhukar Anant Rege passed away at age 92, on September 20th, 2016, after a long illness and a long, full life on three continents. <br>  <br> Born in Ratnagiri on the Konkan Coast of India, he had a happy, active childhood. From an early age he loved drawing and painting and eventually earned a Diploma in Architecture at the J.J. School of Art in Bombay, after apprenticing for a year with the master watercolorist Sawlaram Haldankar. In 1949, at age 25, he set sail for England with the help of his eldest brother Vinayak, where he successfully sat the R.I.B.A. (Royal Institute of British Architects) examination and then completed a post-graduate Diploma in Town Planning. <br>  <br> It was in England that he met and married Gladys Sharp on July 4th, 1953, and, after the birth of their first daughter in 1954, returned to India, where he took up a lectureship in Architecture at the newly formed Indian Institute of Technology in Kharagpur, West Bengal. He was to stay at I.I.T. for 14 years, aside from a year's leave in London and a three-year period in Athens, Greece where he worked with the pioneering Doxiadis Associates, after which he returned to Kharagpur as Professor and Head of the Department of Architecture and City Planning. <br>  <br> In 1969 he migrated to the United States, first as a SPURS (Special Program for Urban and Regional Studies) Fellow at M.I.T. in Cambridge, Massachusetts, then as a city planner for the City of Newton and eventually as a planner for the Massachusetts Executive Office of Communities and Development, where he worked in the Main Street Program on downtown revitalization of Mass. cities and towns. He also lectured at the Boston Architectural Center. When his wife and daughters joined him in 1970, he moved first to Brookline, then to Newton, and, upon retirement in 1993, settled with Gladys in Amherst. After retirement he returned to his first passion, painting, which he had kept up throughout his life, filling his home with beauty. <br>  <br> He was a true Renaissance man: a lifelong reader, always with his head in a book, but also an avid gardener. For many years he practiced yoga regularly. He made toys for his children and most of the furniture for his family, taught himself leatherwork, loved philosophical and political discussions, music, swimming, tennis, and cooking, and was a staunch Democrat, making sure to vote, by absentee ballot, even during his last illness. <br>  <br> He leaves behind Gladys, his loving wife of 63 years; daughters Josna Rege, in Amherst and Sally Rege Carroll, in North Reading, Massachusetts; grandsons Nikhil, in New York City, and Tyler, also from North Reading, currently studying at UMass Amherst; sisters Kumud Rege and Sunita Kulkarni, and brothers Prabhakar and Sadanand Rege, all in Mumbai, India; sons-in-law Andrew and Kevin, many loving nieces and nephews, brothers- and sisters-in law, and fast friends in India, England, and the United States. A great loss to us all, but a life well lived. <br>  <br> Beers and Story Belchertown Funeral Home has been entrusted with the arrangements."}, {"link": "https://www.facebook.com/scholarsavenue/photos/a.294184150131.193021.156819310131/10154446039510132/?type=3", "created_time": "2016-09-28T13:26:26+0000", "real_date": "28-09-2016", "flag": 1, "short_message": "Technology Transfer Group, IIT Kharagpur is conducting a patent drive, the launch event  to which will be held on 29th September 2016 in SN Bose Auditorium.", "id": "156819310131_10154446039510132", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/14522773_10154446039510132_1088846360209754607_n.jpg?oh=295a16d4ca340dffca86d62654e047e3&oe=5860DE0D", "read_more": 1, "source": "The Scholar\"s Avenue", "real_time": "06:56PM", "message": "Technology Transfer Group, IIT Kharagpur is conducting a patent drive, the launch event  to which will be held on 29th September 2016 in SN Bose Auditorium.

Despite the introduction of several savings and alternative measures like replacement of traditional halogen street lamps with LED, sensor operated lights and installation of solar panels, this sharp upswing whereas can be attributed to an increase in research facilities and functioning of four new halls viz. RLB, LBS, BRH & NVH; it cannot be ruled out completely that the misuse and wastage do not have a colossal rise. The hall and department wise data obtained from the Electric Office unveils that the consumption has increased drastically in almost every hall and department. <br> Many a times we are seen to leave the lights and fans running while we go to the class; not because of our unwillingness but because of our carelessness. We should always remember that there are still 19,706 villages in our India (Data as of 2015, Census Board, Ministry of Home Affairs, Govt. of India) which remain un-electrified even after 69 years of our independence.
