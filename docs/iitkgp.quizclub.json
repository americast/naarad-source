It continued the trend of first-timers leaving right after prelims without waiting for the results for yet another day in a row where the third member of the (later on)first place team left, assuming she wouldn't qualify. Considering that almost all of the participants being first-time quizzers, the scores received in the prelims and finals results were very competitive.\nThe aim of the event had been to try and introduce women to the sport and the response, especially in the finals from teams was very positive, with blocks and enthusiastic hint requests and clarifications going around on questions.

One of them didn't submit their contact details so we couldn't even reach them to let them know and hence had to take the next highest scorer present. We later got to know that there were two-three people who didn't want to see if they could qualify and didn't submit their answer sheet for checking, where it turned out that they would've actually qualified for the finals. The team that won actually had a member like that, who after giving up, decided to go to his room, from where he had to be called to come back for the finals and eventually won.
