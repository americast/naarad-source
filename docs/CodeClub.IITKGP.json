This will be conducted in sync with a worldwide audience across the United States, Singapore, and other Indian cities. Each session every Saturday will be divided into 3 parts where we will implement AI algorithms, discuss research papers, online material and have some interesting discussions. \n\nThe session will have a preliminary understanding of Python as a must and here are some resources to help you with that:\nhttps://www.dataquest.io/  for a good guided Python introduction explanations and exercises: (Intro to Python available on free plan)\n\nPython refresher + numpy+ matplotlib by Stanford (https://github.com/kuleshov/cs228-material/blob/master/tutorials/python/cs228-python-tutorial.ipynb)\n\nPandas tutorials(https://bitbucket.org/hrojas/learn-pandas)\n\nWe are very glad to be a part of this and hope you too will benefit from this initiative. \nThe first session will be in January(tentatively on 13th January). All those interested kindly fill the registration form given below. The details regarding the sessions will be shared with the registered students soon.

Also, this being a student initiative we request all interested research scholars and seniors to mentor us and help us make it a grand success. \n\nLet us all join this wave of change and be a part of a global community comprising eminent researchers, PhDs, and students. \n\nSign-Up form:\nhttps://goo.gl/forms/AluX7UZLVFL5bgIg1\n\nFor more details, contact:\nSubham Rajgaria: 9830331068\nSiddharth Singh: 8826219130"}, {"created_time": "2017-12-06T10:09:41+0000", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/CodeClub.IITKGP/photos/a.508108809279586.1073741828.505357142888086/1547793025311154/?type=3", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/24831213_1547793025311154_6962027459123900468_o.jpg?oh=3bf6bf9dd57f46d5556d0459cee249d8&oe=5AF6A670", "id": "505357142888086_1547796821977441", "message": "CodeClub, IIT Kharagpur presents to you CodeNite 2.0.
