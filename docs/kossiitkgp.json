You can find a lot of GSoCers from KGP[3] over there, so don't hesitate.\n\nWe had mentioned about FLOSS Manuals[4] for the students. You must give this a read. It is written in a very simple and lucid manner and is one of the most useful resources for you right now.\n\nYou should also give a light read to a classic article on How to Ask Smart Questions[5]. And this is not just for GSoC !\n\nAnd finally, here are a bunch of resources for you to learn Git[6], which you would be using later.\n\nEmail us or ask on KLUG slack for any help that we can provide. Do not hesitate. :)\n\n[1] https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1c5FZLeNqGvcG4xRVK2BVI0nKAbQqCWMJrxcWBSEKR74 \n[2] https://klug.slack.com \n[3] https://wiki.metakgp.org/w/Google_Summer_of_Code \n[4] http://write.flossmanuals.net/gsocstudentguide/what-is-google-summer-of-code/\n[5] http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html\n[6] https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jsun1_rU4VcK9N059NZyO3GcG9qI1LJgazoj5lSre5E\n\nCheers !"}, {"id": "524856034258068_385303521856181", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/s720x720/16836590_1272732929470371_1457023890186937162_o.jpg?oh=3c22bc796efaa3c80d284202cbe35e45&oe=596B58DC", "story": "Kharagpur Open Source Society - KOSS added an event.", "created_time": "2017-02-26T10:14:54+0000", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/events/385303521856181/", "message": "\nYes, it is that time of the year again when you have to convert coffee to code.
