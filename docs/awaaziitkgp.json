Mr. Niladri Sarkar had claimed himself to pursue MS at Mechanical Engineering Department of IIT KGP and having worked as External Research Associate in the Fluid Dynamics Lab of MIT. He also claimed to be pursuing research at IIT Madras and IIT Bombay at different point of times. A few months ago, when he was in KGP campus, he started approaching faculty members stating that he is an alumnus of IIT KGP and he is willing to collaborate with them for his MIT Project. However, when he was confronted by one of our alumni, Dr. Kaushik Mukherjee on sensing a foul play, he took down most of these claims from social media. Upon contacting the concerned MIT professor, it was also found out that his MIT claim was totally fake. He social engineered his way into IIT KGP. He started adding IITians (and KGPians) to his friend list. Upon seeing a lot of mutual friends, the other students added him. He then approached the junior batches posing himself as an alumnus who was visiting the college on the pretext of meeting some professors and doing research. Many students on the campus got swayed by his claims and his online activities. The students somehow thought of Mr. Niladri Sarkar as a great academician, probably all due to his Quora popularity! And this is why the students were generous enough to lend him money as and whenever he requested. He asked many students for money stating his poor financial conditions and most of them did lend him money which hasn\u2019t been returned yet. The amount that has been taken by him from the students sums up to be a hefty amount. \nThe following were the claims of Mr. Niladri Sarkar:\n1) Mr. Sarkar claims himself to be an IIT KGP student in both his Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/niladri.sarkar.3701) and Quora (https://www.quora.com/profile/Niladri-Sarkar-5) profiles which is false.\n2) He pursued MS under the supervision of Prof. P. K. Das, Department of Mechanical Engineering. We confirmed it from the professor and he denied knowing any such student under his guidance.\n3) He has an Institute ID card which does not look like the regular ones that we have.\n4) He claims to have three research papers none of which are available online since they are done in collaboration with DRDO and AIIMS. These research papers are available within IIT Council, that\u2019s what he has told some people.\n5) A mail from Prof. Indranil Manna, Director, IIT Kanpur praising his research works.\n6) The Research Quality Index certificate stating that he scored 100/100 in research and obtained an AIR 1. This certificate is claimed to be issued jointly by IIT Kanpur. According to him, this certificate is issued once in five years. However, we weren\u2019t able to find out any such Index or program being organised by any IIT or IISc.\n7) Interaction with Prof. S. K. Dash, Head, Department of Mechanical Engineering and other Professors of the department in Nalanda Class Room Complex. \n8. The offer of direct PhD studentship from Prof. Pradip Dutta, Professor and Chair, Department of Mechanical Engineering, IISc.\n9) A mail from Dean MIT expressing their willingness to participate in the Indian Research Quality Index Conference which is going to be organised by him at IIT Kharagpur. No such conference took place in reality.\n10) Selection as External Research Associate in Fluid Dynamics Lab of MIT under the supervision of Prof. John Bush. Upon contacting Prof. Bush regarding the validity of the report, the document was found to be fraudulent. Prof. Bush denied having any such student under his supervision\n11) A nice conversation with Prof. Souvik Bhattacharyya, Senior Professor and Vice-Chancellor, BITS Pilani.\n 12) Telephonic interaction with Prof. Amitabha Ghosh, former Director of IIT KGP\n13) The evaluation report of MIT Fluid Dynamics Lab. \n14) There is also one online article (https://www.kenfolios.com/dont-topper-successful-proved-style/) wherein he was claimed to be KGPian.\nMost of these claims have been found false. Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur requests all the students to beware of such people including him and do not get swayed by any kind of unauthentic claims.

No need, now, to be afoot and toil in the scorching sun or get drained in the rainwater to reach your destination inside the campus. Ola Pedal is here and this has been made possible due to the great efforts of the Technology Students' Gymkhana. Now you can pick up a cycle from any of the Ola Parking Zones, majorly in the Halls of Residence, Main Building, Vikramshila and Nalanda. Using the cycles would cost you INR 5/- for the period of 15 minutes exclusive of taxes and would amount to about INR 6/- for the period including them. Just download the regular Ola Mobile App and you can book the ride, cashless and hassle-free. Enter the number below the QR code at the rear mudguard or the lock module of the cycle with the App and your cycle unlocks, ready to give your hair, the sway in the cool breeze of Kharagpur. The Ola Parking Zones are the only spots where the ride can begin or end. You can lock or unlock the cycle at any place other than these zones but the ride will continue to be chargeable in that case.

Which team does that? No team does that unless it's IIT Kharagpur! The kind of legacy that IIT KGP has built over the years has earned them the tag of \"Tech Giants\" among the IITs. The technical prowess seems to be in the culture of KGP that makes this back to back sweeping of medals and podiums in the tech meet look so effortless. But a lot goes into the background while preparing for the same. And that's why all the team members of Inter IIT Tech contingent deserve a thunderous applause.     \nThe contingent captain Rishabh Shrivastava puts this victory into words, \u201cI'm extremely proud of the contingent which performed astonishingly well to come on top among 19 IITs (highest number of IITs participating in any inter IIT Meet). A big shout-out to the tempo of the contingent which superseded the lack of resources provided to us and kept believing in themselves. We won by huge margins in the real-life problem statements that were put forward by different industries and such a high quality performance of KGPians is a clear indication of the fact that IIT KGP is way ahead in tackling real world issues.\u201d\nAs General Secretary Technology (TSG), Anusha Sharan puts it by stating, \"Having received podium positions in the Inter IIT Tech Meet for the past four years with 3 Gold and 1 Silver, the Tech contingents have more than proved their mettle as compared to the other IITs. And it deserves a bit more spotlight in terms of resources and attention.\"\nSome participants do admit that things could have been bit better when it comes to timely and adequate allocation of resources. They felt that there was a bit inconvenience due to lack of timely and proper assistance that should have been ideally provided. All we can say for now is \"All is well that ends well\".

The degree will be awarded by IIT Kharagpur.\n\nSource: https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/iit-kharagpur-tata-medical-center-kolkata-to-launch-joint-programs/articleshow/62256250.cms?from=mdr", "created_time": "2017-12-27T08:01:09+0000", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/iit-kharagpur-tata-medical-center-kolkata-to-launch-joint-programs/articleshow/62256250.cms?from=mdr", "pic": null, "id": "146188872068143_1694380450582303"}, {"message": "In a first among the IITs, IIT Kharagpur will soon start certifying food items at its campus for their nutritional value and also check for adulteration.\nThe Analytical Food Testing (AFT) Laboratory at IIT Kharagpur received the National Accreditation Board for Calibration and Testing Laboratories' (NABL) accreditation this month.The lab has the most sophisticated high-end equipment to check for adulteration and quality, and is at par with any international laboratory, according to Professor Rintu Banerjee, Department of Agricultural and Food Engineering and the in-charge of AFT Laboratory. \nThis is for the first time that any lab in any of the IITs or NITs has been given this accreditation, which has certified food testing in the laboratory.\n\nSource: https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/education/iit-kharagpur-to-test-and-certify-food-items-at-its-campus/articleshow/62244418.cms", "created_time": "2017-12-26T14:53:53+0000", "link": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/education/iit-kharagpur-to-test-and-certify-food-items-at-its-campus/articleshow/62244418.cms", "pic": null, "id": "146188872068143_1693714837315531"}, {"message": "In a first among the IITs, IIT Kharagpur will soon start certifying food items at its campus for their nutritional value and also check for adulteration.\nThe Analytical Food Testing (AFT) Laboratory at IIT Kharagpur received the National Accreditation Board for Calibration and Testing Laboratories' (NABL) accreditation this month.The lab has the most sophisticated high-end equipment to check for adulteration and quality, and is at par with any international laboratory, according to Professor Rintu Banerjee, Department of Agricultural and Food Engineering and the in-charge of AFT Laboratory. \nThis is for the first time that any lab in any of the IITs or NITs has been given this accreditation, which has certified food testing in the laboratory.\n\nSource: https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/education/iit-kharagpur-to-test-and-certify-food-items-at-its-campus/articleshow/62244418.cms", "created_time": "2017-12-26T14:53:53+0000", "link": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/education/iit-kharagpur-to-test-and-certify-food-items-at-its-campus/articleshow/62244418.cms", "pic": null, "id": "146188872068143_1693714837315531"}, {"message": "| A tale of perseverance and resilience \u2013 rising above adversities to defeat the odds |\nDo you know how a team of just 6 girls fought hard their way to the title of Runner-up in a highly injury-prone sport? Do you know when was the last time KGP Women\u2019s Basketball team had reached into the finals of Inter IIT Sports Meet? No, you might not be knowing! Let us tell you. It was 2004 and it\u2019s after a gap of 13 years that these girls have repeated the same in style by winning the silver medal with an undefeated run till finals! But this journey has neither been a cakewalk nor they were served it easily on a platter. They upped their ante throughout the tournament and took it to another level when it mattered most. \nIn a fiercely contested contact sport which has high risks of players getting injured, the standard team size used to be 11 and the captain had requested for at least 10. But it was reduced to 9 since the administration felt that there is no need of those 2 extra players in a sport which didn\u2019t have prospects of winning a medal. The Woes didn\u2019t stop there. Out of 9 girls selected for the tournament, one of the most key players had to leave due to a medical emergency at her home. They lost their hopes for the tournament with their star player not being able to make it to the matches. Count goes to 8. One more player sustained an injury and couldn\u2019t play. Count goes to 7. One player was in beginning stages and lacked in the experience that it takes to play at bigger stages. Effective count goes to 6. How do you play a sports tournament which requires 5 players and is highly injury prone? Justina Mathew, Ravali Madambakam, Silla Spandana, Saloni Kirdak, Swati Rawat and Remee Patel did the unthinkable! These six players played the entire tournament (5 matches) without having much luxury of getting substitutes. Out of these players, another key player had an injury in her thumb, which was later found to be a fragment fracture. But she didn't give up, she still took the risk and played all the matches. How about that for an example of perseverance? \u201cA basketball team is like the five fingers on your hand. If you can get them all together, you have a fist.\u201d And they proved so. They not only played, they also topped their pool and steamrolled opponent to reach all the way to finals with 4 wins out of 5 matches in their campaign. And along with winning hearts, they did manage to break the stereotype of basketball being the sport of only tall people. They did it all with good dribblers and long distance shooters.\n\nIn the first match itself, they were pitted against the hosts IIT Madras. Loud cheering, home supporters, taller players and what not! And guess what? They announced their arrival in style by beating the favourite hosts by 18-16. The team that no one was giving a chance to put up a fight has suddenly started looking threatening. As if that was not enough, their second successive win over IIT (ISM) Dhanbad by 15-8 sent a strong caution to the winds that they were here to stay, compete and win; not just to make up for the numbers. They gathered the momentum and their victory chariot didn\u2019t stop there. In Quarter Finals, they comprehensively dribbled past IIT BHU by 23-19, sending shivers down the spine of opponents. It was an all-important Semi-Final clash with IIT Bombay. Stakes were high and odds were unfavourable but they rose to the occasion and delivered a nasty blow to Bombay\u2019s hopes of going into Finals. It was tie neck to neck until the last moment when KGP got two free shots in the last 10 seconds of the match. The captain committed no mistake in firing them and the second one went in giving KGP a lead of one point. Can you believe that? A team which was being seen as the one participating just for formality and were no believers in them getting into knockout stages was into the finals! In the finals, they screamed, they ran ferociously, they dribbled hard, they threw all they had, they put each iota of energy their muscles could but credit to the opponents, they were simply better that day. As our players admitted, IIT Roorkee deserved the gold medal. Though they lost by 25-44, their entire campaign was studded with brilliant moments \u2013 the moments they can take pride on! It was nothing less than a roller coaster ride for them where they defied their own expectations and proved the pundits wrong. All the practice, hard work and perseverance bore sweet fruits. \nIt wasn\u2019t their victory alone. It was also a big win for their coach Mr Soumen Mondal who played a pivotal role in motivating the team and strategizing for each match. He believed in them and always reminded them of their potential of getting a podium finish. As the players said, \u201cWithout his strategies, the victory wasn\u2019t possible.\u201d The never-say-die attitude of the team was all he wanted and girls didn\u2019t disappoint him. The captain Remee marshalled her troop well and her leadership was the key to this entire campaign. A huge shout to these amazing girls! \nWhat lies in the future? Most of the current players are graduating out. The team needs enthusiastic and dedicated junior players to fill the boots. As one of the players admitted, even during the practice sessions, participation from juniors was very less. They had a hard time choosing 9 players for the tournament. Participation from girls was utterly disappointing. And if that\u2019s what will keep on going, we don\u2019t stand a chance in rewriting histories in the upcoming Sports Meets. The current players have appealed to the girls to participate in as large numbers as possible. The sports scenario in KGP among girls isn\u2019t in very good shape right now. We needed inspirations to look up to. Now that we have some of them, why to wait? Hit the ground on the very first day of the next semester!", "id": "146188872068143_1690953644258317", "story": "Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur is with Priyanka Bhaskar and 6 others.", "created_time": "2017-12-25T15:03:47+0000", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/awaaziitkgp/photos/a.146211918732505.22874.146188872068143/1690953644258317/?type=3", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/25626256_1690953644258317_4059116407686528605_o.jpg?oh=829eb77d3ac432d300354fc43e0ac5e1&oe=5AF576D3"}, {"message": "GC 2016-17 || Sports and Games || Inter Hall Badminton\n\nThird place match: Patel vs MMM2\nResult: Patel won by 2-0 as they won both in the singles and the doubles.\nWith these final Hall standings are:\n1.
