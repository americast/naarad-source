JCB won the toss and elected to bat first. After putting a decent total of 138 runs, it was Nehru's turn to chase. The match was equally balanced till the last over when Nehru needed 8 runs off the final over. That was not all, Ramakrishna brought down the gap to 6 runs needed in two balls. But, Nehru's batsman Vishwajeet Teja had something else in mind. He scored a boundary off the 5th ball and sprinted for a couple on the final ball to go past JCB's total of 138 runs defeating them by 5 wickets. <br>  <br> The scores were as follow: <br> JCB: 138/7 (20) <br> NH: 139/5 (20) <br> With this win, NH advances to the Semi-finals of Cricket. For further updates, stay tuned to our page. <br>  <br> Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur congratulates the winning team and wishes them all the best for their upcoming match!

When our reporters tried to dig this matter up, what they found was something that reveals the sheer negligence of some of the students.

Due to some of the students, many students who used to pay their semester fees with the MCM scholarship money have not been able too register yet. Other students who are in dire need of financial assistance and MCM has been their only source for the same, are also facing difficulties of various degrees.

In what is being hailed as one of the most impactful academic reforms in recent times, students have been given the freedom to take subjects of equivalent credits in place of BTP. <br> Also, a student can register for B.Tech. projects in other departments and such projects will be evaluated by the department where the student is pursuing the project. Students pursuing minors or micro-specialisations and research output of IIT Kharagpur - both are bound to get affected by this new provision. This decision is expected to take most of the students by surprise for sure and the academic landscape will see a probable drastic change from the next academic session.

Project (BTP) has been made optional with effect from academic session 2018-19. In what is being hailed as one of the most impactful academic reforms in recent times, students have been given the freedom to take subjects of equivalent credits in place of BTP. <br> Also, a student can register for B.Tech. projects in other departments and such projects will be evaluated by the department where the student is pursuing the project. Students pursuing minors or micro-specialisations and research output of IIT Kharagpur - both are bound to get affected by this new provision. This decision is expected to take most of the students by surprise for sure and the academic landscape will see a probable drastic change from the next academic session.

The performance was scintillating! <br>  <br> Approximately 300 alumni, from the batches of '68, '78, and '93, are enjoying their return back to campus. <br>  <br> One of the alumni who was also a part of the Springfest organising committee expressed his jubilation on coming back for the first time since graduation.  <br> 'A lot has changed.

Day 1 of the three day event began with a campus tour followed by a departmental visit. A 'Musical Night' was organised in which the a few alumni of the '93 batch who had a band named 'Still Waters' took to the stage to perform some age old classics after a gap of 25 years. The performance was scintillating! <br>  <br> Approximately 300 alumni, from the batches of '68, '78, and '93, are enjoying their return back to campus. <br>  <br> One of the alumni who was also a part of the Springfest organising committee expressed his jubilation on coming back for the first time since graduation.  <br> 'A lot has changed. There are roads and pathways everywhere. Boys are definitely more disciplined than we were. I wish I could have those days back', he told The Scholars' Avenue. <br>  <br> Day 1 of the meet will come to an end with the much anticipated hall visits.

                        <a href="#" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#big" data-source=" Awaaz IIT Kharagpur " data-message=" | A tale of perseverance and resilience – rising above adversities to defeat the odds | <br> Do you know how a team of just 6 girls fought hard their way to the title of Runner-up in a highly injury-prone sport? Do you know when was the last time KGP Women’s Basketball team had reached into the finals of Inter IIT Sports Meet? No, you might not be knowing! Let us tell you. It was 2004 and it’s after a gap of 13 years that these girls have repeated the same in style by winning the silver medal with an undefeated run till finals! But this journey has neither been a cakewalk nor they were served it easily on a platter. They upped their ante throughout the tournament and took it to another level when it mattered most.  <br> In a fiercely contested contact sport which has high risks of players getting injured, the standard team size used to be 11 and the captain had requested for at least 10. But it was reduced to 9 since the administration felt that there is no need of those 2 extra players in a sport which didn’t have prospects of winning a medal. The Woes didn’t stop there. Out of 9 girls selected for the tournament, one of the most key players had to leave due to a medical emergency at her home. They lost their hopes for the tournament with their star player not being able to make it to the matches. Count goes to 8. One more player sustained an injury and couldn’t play. Count goes to 7. One player was in beginning stages and lacked in the experience that it takes to play at bigger stages. Effective count goes to 6. How do you play a sports tournament which requires 5 players and is highly injury prone? Justina Mathew, Ravali Madambakam, Silla Spandana, Saloni Kirdak, Swati Rawat and Remee Patel did the unthinkable! These six players played the entire tournament (5 matches) without having much luxury of getting substitutes. Out of these players, another key player had an injury in her thumb, which was later found to be a fragment fracture. But she didn't give up, she still took the risk and played all the matches. How about that for an example of perseverance? “A basketball team is like the five fingers on your hand. If you can get them all together, you have a fist.” And they proved so. They not only played, they also topped their pool and steamrolled opponent to reach all the way to finals with 4 wins out of 5 matches in their campaign. And along with winning hearts, they did manage to break the stereotype of basketball being the sport of only tall people. They did it all with good dribblers and long distance shooters. <br>  <br> In the first match itself, they were pitted against the hosts IIT Madras. Loud cheering, home supporters, taller players and what not! And guess what? They announced their arrival in style by beating the favourite hosts by 18-16. The team that no one was giving a chance to put up a fight has suddenly started looking threatening. As if that was not enough, their second successive win over IIT (ISM) Dhanbad by 15-8 sent a strong caution to the winds that they were here to stay, compete and win; not just to make up for the numbers. They gathered the momentum and their victory chariot didn’t stop there. In Quarter Finals, they comprehensively dribbled past IIT BHU by 23-19, sending shivers down the spine of opponents. It was an all-important Semi-Final clash with IIT Bombay. Stakes were high and odds were unfavourable but they rose to the occasion and delivered a nasty blow to Bombay’s hopes of going into Finals. It was tie neck to neck until the last moment when KGP got two free shots in the last 10 seconds of the match. The captain committed no mistake in firing them and the second one went in giving KGP a lead of one point. Can you believe that? A team which was being seen as the one participating just for formality and were no believers in them getting into knockout stages was into the finals! In the finals, they screamed, they ran ferociously, they dribbled hard, they threw all they had, they put each iota of energy their muscles could but credit to the opponents, they were simply better that day. As our players admitted, IIT Roorkee deserved the gold medal. Though they lost by 25-44, their entire campaign was studded with brilliant moments – the moments they can take pride on! It was nothing less than a roller coaster ride for them where they defied their own expectations and proved the pundits wrong. All the practice, hard work and perseverance bore sweet fruits.  <br> It wasn’t their victory alone. It was also a big win for their coach Mr Soumen Mondal who played a pivotal role in motivating the team and strategizing for each match. He believed in them and always reminded them of their potential of getting a podium finish. As the players said, “Without his strategies, the victory wasn’t possible.” The never-say-die attitude of the team was all he wanted and girls didn’t disappoint him. The captain Remee marshalled her troop well and her leadership was the key to this entire campaign. A huge shout to these amazing girls!  <br> What lies in the future? Most of the current players are graduating out. The team needs enthusiastic and dedicated junior players to fill the boots. As one of the players admitted, even during the practice sessions, participation from juniors was very less. They had a hard time choosing 9 players for the tournament. Participation from girls was utterly disappointing. And if that’s what will keep on going, we don’t stand a chance in rewriting histories in the upcoming Sports Meets. The current players have appealed to the girls to participate in as large numbers as possible. The sports scenario in KGP among girls isn’t in very good shape right now. We needed inspirations to look up to. Now that we have some of them, why to wait? Hit the ground on the very first day of the next semester!

Another different aspect of this edition was that children just didn't perform, their performances were also based on social evils like child marriage, dowry, gender inequality etc. which still prevail in their villages , and we are sure such an event will create a difference in the mindsets of the people, and motivate them to break free of these traditions.  <br> The event saw the participation of over 70 children and was spectated by their parents and other residents of the village.

From an early age he loved drawing and painting and eventually earned a Diploma in Architecture at the J.J. School of Art in Bombay, after apprenticing for a year with the master watercolorist Sawlaram Haldankar. In 1949, at age 25, he set sail for England with the help of his eldest brother Vinayak, where he successfully sat the R.I.B.A. (Royal Institute of British Architects) examination and then completed a post-graduate Diploma in Town Planning. <br>  <br> It was in England that he met and married Gladys Sharp on July 4th, 1953, and, after the birth of their first daughter in 1954, returned to India, where he took up a lectureship in Architecture at the newly formed Indian Institute of Technology in Kharagpur, West Bengal. He was to stay at I.I.T. for 14 years, aside from a year's leave in London and a three-year period in Athens, Greece where he worked with the pioneering Doxiadis Associates, after which he returned to Kharagpur as Professor and Head of the Department of Architecture and City Planning. <br>  <br> In 1969 he migrated to the United States, first as a SPURS (Special Program for Urban and Regional Studies) Fellow at M.I.T. in Cambridge, Massachusetts, then as a city planner for the City of Newton and eventually as a planner for the Massachusetts Executive Office of Communities and Development, where he worked in the Main Street Program on downtown revitalization of Mass. cities and towns. He also lectured at the Boston Architectural Center. When his wife and daughters joined him in 1970, he moved first to Brookline, then to Newton, and, upon retirement in 1993, settled with Gladys in Amherst. After retirement he returned to his first passion, painting, which he had kept up throughout his life, filling his home with beauty. <br>  <br> He was a true Renaissance man: a lifelong reader, always with his head in a book, but also an avid gardener. For many years he practiced yoga regularly. He made toys for his children and most of the furniture for his family, taught himself leatherwork, loved philosophical and political discussions, music, swimming, tennis, and cooking, and was a staunch Democrat, making sure to vote, by absentee ballot, even during his last illness. <br>  <br> He leaves behind Gladys, his loving wife of 63 years; daughters Josna Rege, in Amherst and Sally Rege Carroll, in North Reading, Massachusetts; grandsons Nikhil, in New York City, and Tyler, also from North Reading, currently studying at UMass Amherst; sisters Kumud Rege and Sunita Kulkarni, and brothers Prabhakar and Sadanand Rege, all in Mumbai, India; sons-in-law Andrew and Kevin, many loving nieces and nephews, brothers- and sisters-in law, and fast friends in India, England, and the United States.
