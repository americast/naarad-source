Their stories are an inspiration to every Kgpian and we take honour in bringing to you their achievements and their road to success.\n\nSwami Smaranananda Giri | EC, 1980 | JCB\n\nSwami Smaranananda Giri did his PhD from the Department of Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering in 1980. He is the General Secretary of the Yogoda Satsanga Society of India, founded by Sri Paramahansa Yogananda in 1917. He was a Gold Medalist in School Final and in Engineering. He served at IIT Kharagpur as a Senior Research Assistant, at Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, Hyderabad as a Design Engineer, at Siddhardha Engineering College, Vijayawada as an Assistant Professor, at Concordia University, Montreal, Canada as a Post-Doctoral Fellow, and at the Centre for Navigational Electronics, Osmania University, Hyderabad as a Senior Scientist. In 1985 Swami Smaranananda was to decide whether to join the former President of India Dr. Abdul Kalam in his missile project as a Scientist or Yogoda Satsanga Ashram as a sannyasi, and chose the latter.
