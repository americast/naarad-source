And then there's the \"revolutionary\" path.

But these paths will eventually converge.\n \nToday's most advanced semi-autonomous features can be found in Tesla's and a few other cars that allow drivers to take their hands off the steering wheel on a highway. Using a series of sensors and cameras, cars can also merge, self-park, stay within a lane and brake as needed.\n \nThis tech works particularly well for commercial trucks that operate on highways. Companies like Peloton and NXP are \"platooning\" trucks \u2014 tying them together through a vehicle-to-vehicle communication system.
