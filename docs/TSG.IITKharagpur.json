The SIH was primarily a code-fest in which software programmers were challenged to write programmes giving innovative solutions to more than 500 problem statements. The SIH-2017 elicited an enthusiastic response with more than 40,000 students participating. It was concluded in the first week of April 2017 with Hon\u2019ble PM addressing the participants. This is being followed with Smart India Hackathon-2018 which was formally launched details of which can be found in https://innovate.mygov.in/sih2018/.\n\nThe MHRD now proposes to expand the scope of SIH-2018 by including hardware section in it. This platform will provide an opportunity to the innovative minds to showcase their solutions at the national level. It is also proposed that the best entries at the national level would also be provided funding through the Research Parks and the Technology Business Incubators (TBIs) for product development for their eventual commercialisation/extensive social use.\n\nThe MHRD expects a good participation in this Hackathon from all the IITs and NITs.\n\nAll students are requested to provide ideas (with or without models/prototypes) that will be proposed as problem statements of the Smart India Hackathon 2018. This should be done by mailing the idea totech.gymkhana@gmail.com by 13th November, 2 AM.\n\nYou are also requested to go through the 400+ problem statements provided in the aforementioned link and register for the Hackathon.

We hope your mid-semester exams went well.\n\nAs the library site was down for most part of mid-semester exams, our site MFQP was also rendered to be down for the first few days, but we found a way out so that we could keep serving papers to everyone in KGP! Now, let's all contribute, and increase the papers MFQP has. Our Paper Collection Drive starts today! We request everyone to submit their mid-semester question papers.\n\nHere's how you can contribute - Click, Upload & Send.\n\n1. Take a picture of your question paper\n2. Write Subject Code in email\n3. Send to metakgp-qp@googlegroups.com\n\nAnd, do visit http://metakgp.github.io/mfqp-source/ \n\nNever go to an exam without having had a look at the previous year's paper! Let's all work towards achieving that goal.\n\nThat's all folks!
