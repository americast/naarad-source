He had a lot of interesting things to say on this front and much more.\n\nCheck out the link below to share some of his thoughts on several topics ranging from intrepreneurship, free Wi-Fi to how Google shaped him into what he is today.\n\n https://youtu.be/69NctEpzNUI", "pic": null, "link": "https://youtu.be/69NctEpzNUI"}, {"link": "https://www.facebook.com/scholarsavenue/photos/a.10151912978410132.1073741840.156819310131/10155958712115132/?type=3", "story": "The Scholars' Avenue added a new photo.", "id": "156819310131_10155958712115132", "created_time": "2018-02-08T12:57:20+0000", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/27907615_10155958712115132_3229864701552313871_o.jpg?oh=62a7c45037eda28fdac9b6af958bcd55&oe=5B072BBB", "message": "\"People often say that motivation doesn't last.

The project to develop a pilot for NDLI was also awarded to IIT Kharagpur which was completed well before the scheduled time. This is the primary reason why IIT Kharagpur was awarded the second phase. Visit https://ndl.iitkgp.ac.in/ to register and have a look at the beta version of NDLI.\n\nPhase-II of the project aims to develop the Pilot to a full-fledged NDLI with an aim to build a National Asset. This project will enable some key national knowledge discovery and immersive learning platforms built around the Digital Library. It will also encourage the entrepreneurial development of tools and apps around this platform. In its final contour, the system may serve as a pan-India virtual teaching-learning-evaluation-knowledge discovery and innovation platform, evolving as a key National Asset.\n    \nNDLI is getting structured along verticals like School, Competitive Exams and Career Development, Engineering, Medical, Law, etc. Under the Competitive Exams & Career Development vertical, NDLI is going to make available solutions (with explanations, alternate solutions, reference study materials and annotations) to all IIT-JEE Question Papers (since 2007) to benefit a large number of IIT-JEE aspirants.\n\nThe project is, thus, inviting applications from students who are currently in their 1st year of studies (Engineering, Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics) and are willing to work as part-time Intern to prepare Solutions for JEE Question Papers.

Fondly remembered by many students and admirers.\n\nAmherst - Madhukar Anant Rege passed away at age 92, on September 20th, 2016, after a long illness and a long, full life on three continents.\n\nBorn in Ratnagiri on the Konkan Coast of India, he had a happy, active childhood. From an early age he loved drawing and painting and eventually earned a Diploma in Architecture at the J.J. School of Art in Bombay, after apprenticing for a year with the master watercolorist Sawlaram Haldankar. In 1949, at age 25, he set sail for England with the help of his eldest brother Vinayak, where he successfully sat the R.I.B.A. (Royal Institute of British Architects) examination and then completed a post-graduate Diploma in Town Planning.\n\nIt was in England that he met and married Gladys Sharp on July 4th, 1953, and, after the birth of their first daughter in 1954, returned to India, where he took up a lectureship in Architecture at the newly formed Indian Institute of Technology in Kharagpur, West Bengal. He was to stay at I.I.T. for 14 years, aside from a year's leave in London and a three-year period in Athens, Greece where he worked with the pioneering Doxiadis Associates, after which he returned to Kharagpur as Professor and Head of the Department of Architecture and City Planning.\n\nIn 1969 he migrated to the United States, first as a SPURS (Special Program for Urban and Regional Studies) Fellow at M.I.T. in Cambridge, Massachusetts, then as a city planner for the City of Newton and eventually as a planner for the Massachusetts Executive Office of Communities and Development, where he worked in the Main Street Program on downtown revitalization of Mass. cities and towns. He also lectured at the Boston Architectural Center. When his wife and daughters joined him in 1970, he moved first to Brookline, then to Newton, and, upon retirement in 1993, settled with Gladys in Amherst. After retirement he returned to his first passion, painting, which he had kept up throughout his life, filling his home with beauty.\n\nHe was a true Renaissance man: a lifelong reader, always with his head in a book, but also an avid gardener. For many years he practiced yoga regularly. He made toys for his children and most of the furniture for his family, taught himself leatherwork, loved philosophical and political discussions, music, swimming, tennis, and cooking, and was a staunch Democrat, making sure to vote, by absentee ballot, even during his last illness.\n\nHe leaves behind Gladys, his loving wife of 63 years; daughters Josna Rege, in Amherst and Sally Rege Carroll, in North Reading, Massachusetts; grandsons Nikhil, in New York City, and Tyler, also from North Reading, currently studying at UMass Amherst; sisters Kumud Rege and Sunita Kulkarni, and brothers Prabhakar and Sadanand Rege, all in Mumbai, India; sons-in-law Andrew and Kevin, many loving nieces and nephews, brothers- and sisters-in law, and fast friends in India, England, and the United States. A great loss to us all, but a life well lived.\n\nBeers and Story Belchertown Funeral Home has been entrusted with the arrangements."}, {"id": "156819310131_10154446039510132", "created_time": "2016-09-28T13:26:26+0000", "message": "Technology Transfer Group, IIT Kharagpur is conducting a patent drive, the launch event  to which will be held on 29th September 2016 in SN Bose Auditorium.
