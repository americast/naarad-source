The 24-year-old was found hanging from the ceiling fan by security guards around 7 PM. His body was bent over on a table with a rope hanging his neck from the ceiling. There was a delay before the door was struck down. The ambulance arrived at the scene with doctors and Reddy was confirmed dead by the doctors. Dean of Student Affairs, Hall Wardens, Vice President also arrived soon enough to look into the matter. His body was taken to the hospital for Autopsy.\n\nG H Reddy, son of Gangireddy Venkata Reddy, hailed from Andhra Pradesh. He took admission in IIT Kharagpur in 2017 and was a boarder of MMM Hall since. The Hall community is still recovering from the shock of this news.

Despite a low turnover, the programme began only a little off-scheduled at 6:20 in the evening.\n\nThe session started with Somil Gupta and Raghav Jalan of the External Relations Cell conducting a workshop on CV-building. All the key essentials of a CV and a cover letter were discussed here. There was a brief overview of the format, signature and some useful browser extensions while sending a mail, and the protocol to be followed while taking telephonic and personal interviews. It was 7:40 by the time the workshop ended. Despite SWG's portents of upcoming attendance-check, almost half of the already fewer students started leaving for their hostels. \n\nThe session however continued with Abhrajit Saha and Ruchin Raj of the Institute Wellness Group elaborating on the establishment and ideals of IWG. There was then, a display of around 10 popular KGP themed memes. This was shortly followed by a short picture story of a lonely KGP boy facing mental stigma and his prospects of living in the presence and absence of friends. The anecdote then moved on to elucidate the importance and reliability of the Counselling Centre. Then, there was an introduction to YourDOST and a funny demonstration on the working of its interface through a fake YourDOST id \"Spidy69.\" When the counsellor messaged \"Hey, can I call you Spidy?\", the user replied, \"Where is the 69?.\" Abrajit even said, \"Make use of it.

Fondly remembered by many students and admirers.\n\nAmherst - Madhukar Anant Rege passed away at age 92, on September 20th, 2016, after a long illness and a long, full life on three continents.\n\nBorn in Ratnagiri on the Konkan Coast of India, he had a happy, active childhood. From an early age he loved drawing and painting and eventually earned a Diploma in Architecture at the J.J. School of Art in Bombay, after apprenticing for a year with the master watercolorist Sawlaram Haldankar. In 1949, at age 25, he set sail for England with the help of his eldest brother Vinayak, where he successfully sat the R.I.B.A. (Royal Institute of British Architects) examination and then completed a post-graduate Diploma in Town Planning.\n\nIt was in England that he met and married Gladys Sharp on July 4th, 1953, and, after the birth of their first daughter in 1954, returned to India, where he took up a lectureship in Architecture at the newly formed Indian Institute of Technology in Kharagpur, West Bengal. He was to stay at I.I.T. for 14 years, aside from a year's leave in London and a three-year period in Athens, Greece where he worked with the pioneering Doxiadis Associates, after which he returned to Kharagpur as Professor and Head of the Department of Architecture and City Planning.\n\nIn 1969 he migrated to the United States, first as a SPURS (Special Program for Urban and Regional Studies) Fellow at M.I.T. in Cambridge, Massachusetts, then as a city planner for the City of Newton and eventually as a planner for the Massachusetts Executive Office of Communities and Development, where he worked in the Main Street Program on downtown revitalization of Mass. cities and towns. He also lectured at the Boston Architectural Center. When his wife and daughters joined him in 1970, he moved first to Brookline, then to Newton, and, upon retirement in 1993, settled with Gladys in Amherst. After retirement he returned to his first passion, painting, which he had kept up throughout his life, filling his home with beauty.\n\nHe was a true Renaissance man: a lifelong reader, always with his head in a book, but also an avid gardener. For many years he practiced yoga regularly. He made toys for his children and most of the furniture for his family, taught himself leatherwork, loved philosophical and political discussions, music, swimming, tennis, and cooking, and was a staunch Democrat, making sure to vote, by absentee ballot, even during his last illness.\n\nHe leaves behind Gladys, his loving wife of 63 years; daughters Josna Rege, in Amherst and Sally Rege Carroll, in North Reading, Massachusetts; grandsons Nikhil, in New York City, and Tyler, also from North Reading, currently studying at UMass Amherst; sisters Kumud Rege and Sunita Kulkarni, and brothers Prabhakar and Sadanand Rege, all in Mumbai, India; sons-in-law Andrew and Kevin, many loving nieces and nephews, brothers- and sisters-in law, and fast friends in India, England, and the United States. A great loss to us all, but a life well lived.\n\nBeers and Story Belchertown Funeral Home has been entrusted with the arrangements.", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/t31.0-8/14444990_1646951098929315_2732450396443913396_o.jpg", "id": "156819310131_10154446112815132", "created_time": "2016-09-28T13:52:36+0000", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/director.iitkgp/photos/a.1460899854201108.1073741828.1455755204715573/1646951098929315/?type=3"}, {"id": "156819310131_10154446039510132", "message": "Technology Transfer Group, IIT Kharagpur is conducting a patent drive, the launch event  to which will be held on 29th September 2016 in SN Bose Auditorium.

Despite the introduction of several savings and alternative measures like replacement of traditional halogen street lamps with LED, sensor operated lights and installation of solar panels, this sharp upswing whereas can be attributed to an increase in research facilities and functioning of four new halls viz. RLB, LBS, BRH & NVH; it cannot be ruled out completely that the misuse and wastage do not have a colossal rise. The hall and department wise data obtained from the Electric Office unveils that the consumption has increased drastically in almost every hall and department.\nMany a times we are seen to leave the lights and fans running while we go to the class; not because of our unwillingness but because of our carelessness.

Despite the introduction of several savings and alternative measures like replacement of traditional halogen street lamps with LED, sensor operated lights and installation of solar panels, this sharp upswing whereas can be attributed to an increase in research facilities and functioning of four new halls viz. RLB, LBS, BRH & NVH; it cannot be ruled out completely that the misuse and wastage do not have a colossal rise.
